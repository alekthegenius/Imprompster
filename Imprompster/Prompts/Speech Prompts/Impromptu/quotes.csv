For somehow this disease inheres in tyranny, never to trust one's friends.::Aeschylus
It is always in season for old men to learn.::Aeschylus

I want for myself what I want for other women, absolute equality.::Agnes Macphail
It is a fact that all women contribute more to marriage than men for the most part they have to change their place of living, their method of work, a great many women today changing their occupation entirely on marriage and they must even change their name.::Agnes Macphail
I do not want to be the angel of any home: I want for myself what I want for other women, absolute equality. After that is secured, then men and women can take turns being angels.::Agnes Macphail
Happiness is being on the beam with life - to feel the pull of life.::Agnes Martin
When I think of art I think of beauty. Beauty is the mystery of life. It is not in the eye it is in the mind. In our minds there is awareness of perfection.::Agnes Martin
Art is the concrete representation of our most subtle feelings.::Agnes Martin
It is as impossible to withhold education from the receptive mind, as it is impossible to force it upon the unreasoning.::Agnes Repplier
It is not easy to find happiness in ourselves, and it is not possible to find it elsewhere.::Agnes Repplier
A kitten is chiefly remarkable for rushing about like mad at nothing whatever, and generally stopping before it gets there.::Agnes Repplier
Humor brings insight and tolerance. Irony brings a deeper and less friendly understanding.::Agnes Repplier
It is impossible for a lover of cats to banish these alert, gentle, and discriminating friends, who give us just enough of their regard and complaisance to make us hunger for more.::Agnes Repplier
Humor distorts nothing, and only false gods are laughed off their earthly pedestals.::Agnes Repplier
Like all my family and class, I considered it a sign of weakness to show affection to have been caught kissing my mother would have been a disgrace, and to have shown affection for my father would have been a disaster.::Agnes Smedley
Now, being a girl, I was ashamed of my body and my lack of strength. So I tried to be a man. I shot, rode, jumped, and took part in all the fights of the boys.::Agnes Smedley

A good education is usually harmful to a dancer. A good calf is better than a good head.::Agnes de Mille

Peace does not include a vendetta there will be neither winners nor losers.::Ahmed Ben Bella
Days will prove that the assassination policy will not finish the Hamas. Hamas leaders wish to be martyrs and are not scared of death. Jihad will continue and the resistance will continue until we have victory, or we will be martyrs.::Ahmed Yassin
The so-called peace path is not peace and it is not a substitute for jihad and resistance.::Ahmed Yassin
We do not trust the goodwill of the U.S. They have cut the ties.::Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani
I think that Americans should gradually begin to adopt positive behavior rather than doing evil. They should not expect an immediate reaction in return for their positive measures. It will take time.::Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani
The problem is that the Iraqi people are facing atrocities from both sides - Zarqawi and also the American troops at times. The Zarqawi groups uses car bombs, the Americans use other bombs. You also know what they do in the prisons.::Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani
We have no problems with Jews and highly respect Judaism as a holy religion.::Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani
I believe the main solution is to gain the trust of Europe and America and to remove their concerns over the peaceful nature of our nuclear industry and to assure them that there will never be a diversion to military use.::Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani

We've got to win this battle, and we will. We have to win the peace.::Al D'Amato
Philosophy is an attempt by man to find cause and effect. Religion has the same goal.::Al Goldstein
If you cannot work on the marriage or the women is a moron, staying married and cheating makes the most sense because divorce is disruptive to the family life and your bank account.::Al Goldstein
Since fame is an illusion and death is in our future all we have is the next moment before we are swallowed into oblivion.::Al Goldstein
Celebrity gives us delusion of self importance.::Al Goldstein
Even though marriage is doomed, if you turned it into a job you like and really work at it - it can be salvaged.::Al Goldstein
For me working on the marriage and not making the easy choice of cheating was something that I could not do.::Al Goldstein
The only way marriage can work is if a man respects the woman and she is a thinking woman and he wants to work on the marriage.::Al Goldstein
One reason outfielders don't have stronger arms might be they don't practice as much as we did. Most teams today don't take outfield practice. Another reason is baseball has to compete with other sports now - basketball, football, soccer - for the better athletes that might have more skills and stronger arms.::Al Kaline
Remember, half the doctors in this country graduated in the bottom half of their class.::Al McGuire
Winning is overrated. The only time it is really important is in surgery and war.::Al McGuire
I don't know why people question the academic training of an athlete. Fifty percent of the doctors in this country graduated in the bottom half of their classes.::Al McGuire
I think everyone should go to college and get a degree and then spend six months as a bartender and six months as a cabdriver. Then they would really be educated.::Al McGuire
I've got a great team of engineers behind this race car. I've got a great bunch of mechanics that make it reliable. This car is developed to go out there and be better than the Reynard, and I feel that it is.::Al Unser
Dad taught me everything I know. Unfortunately, he didn't teach me everything he knows.::Al Unser
Evil is the moment when I lack the strength to be true to the Good that compels me.::Alain Badiou
Evil is the interruption of a truth by the pressure of particular or individual interests.::Alain Badiou
I knew everything and received everything. But real happiness, is giving.::Alain Delon
I used to be a Catholic. I left because I object to conversion by concussion. If you don't agree with what they teach, you get clobbered over the head until you do. All that does is change the shape of the head.::Alan Alda
Be as smart as you can, but remember that it is always better to be wise than to be smart.::Alan Alda
If I can't get the girl, at least give me more money.::Alan Alda
I'm most at home on the stage. I was carried onstage for the first time when I was six months old.::Alan Alda
You can't get there by bus, only by hard work and risk and by not quite knowing what you're doing. What you'll discover will be wonderful. What you'll discover will be yourself.::Alan Alda
Here's my Golden Rule for a tarnished age: Be fair with others, but keep after them until they're fair with you.::Alan Alda
You wouldn't want to be called a sell-out by selling a product. Selling out was frowned on, whereas now you can major in it at business school.::Alan Alda
Never Have Your Dog Stuffed is really advice to myself, a reminder to myself not to avoid change or uncertainty, but to go with it, to surf into change.::Alan Alda
I'm an angry person, angrier than most people would imagine, I get flashes of anger. What works for me is working out when it's useful to use that anger.::Alan Alda
It isn't necessary to be rich and famous to be happy. It's only necessary to be rich.::Alan Alda
I find myself going to places where I really have no business, speaking to these people in a whole other field that I have no extensive knowledge of. But I do it very often because it scares me.::Alan Alda
I think everything depends on money.::Alan Bean
Those who have known the famous are publicly debriefed of their memories, knowing as their own dusk falls that they will only be remembered for remembering someone else.::Alan Bennett
There are no true friends in politics. We are all sharks circling, and waiting, for traces of blood to appear in the water.::Alan Clark
In the Pentagon Papers case, the government asserted in the Supreme Court that the publication of the material was a threat to national security. It turned out it was not a threat to U.S. security. But even if it had been, that doesn't mean that it couldn't be published.::Alan Dershowitz
The defendant wants to hide the truth because he's generally guilty. The defense attorney's job is to make sure the jury does not arrive at that truth.::Alan Dershowitz
Great research universities must insist on independence from government and on the exercise of academic freedom.::Alan Dershowitz
I've thought hard about my psychological connections and I think I've managed to separate out the psychological from the legal, moral, and political.::Alan Dershowitz
I came from a poor family, so working and going to school at the same time was natural. It taught me multi-tasking, although we didn't call it that back then. I learned I could never be idle, I need to be doing many things at once.::Alan Dershowitz
I am a peace supporting Jew.::Alan Dershowitz
I am deeply concerned that, without peace and a two-state solution, the Jewish and democratic nature of Israel is in danger. That's why I have opposed Israel's settlement policy since 1973, and that's why I have favored a two-state solution since 1967.::Alan Dershowitz
Israel can't make peace without the clear support of the United States.::Alan Dershowitz
I don't believe in firing professors. They have academic freedom.::Alan Dershowitz
It's never acceptable to target civilians. It violates the Geneva Accords, it violates the international law of war and it violates all principles of morality.::Alan Dershowitz
I think mistakes are the essence of science and law. It's impossible to conceive of either scientific progress or legal progress without understanding the important role of being wrong and of mistakes.::Alan Dershowitz
Twenty five percent of Israeli citizens are not even Jewish. Anybody can become an Israeli citizen if you qualify. Religion is not a criterion for citizenship.::Alan Dershowitz
You know, it's ironic to me that Christians want to keep the Ten Commandments in our schools, because Christianity has abrogated four of the Ten Commandments. For example, the Sabbath day according to the Ten Commandments is Saturday, not Sunday. And the reason is because God rested, not because Jesus was resurrected.::Alan Dershowitz
I learn from experience.::Alan Dershowitz
No country in the history of the world has ever contributed more to humankind and accomplished more for its people in so brief a period of time as Israel has done since its relatively recent rebirth in 1948.::Alan Dershowitz
Judges are the weakest link in our system of justice, and they are also the most protected.::Alan Dershowitz
I think that lawyers are terrible at admitting that they're wrong. And not just admitting it also realizing it. Most lawyers are very successful, and they think that because they're making money and people think well of them, they must be doing everything right.::Alan Dershowitz
We all learn in school that the judicial, legislative and executive branches of government must check and balance each other. But other non state institutions must participate in this important system of checks and balances as well. These checking institutions include the academy, the media, religious institutions and NGOs.::Alan Dershowitz
It simply cannot be disputed that for decades the Palestinian leadership was more interested in there not being a Jewish state than in there being a Palestinian state.::Alan Dershowitz
We don't have an Official Secrets Act in the United States, as other countries do. Under the First Amendment, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and freedom of association are more important than protecting secrets.::Alan Dershowitz
Cities all over the world are getting bigger as more and more people move from rural to urban sites, but that has created enormous problems with respect to environmental pollution and the general quality of life.::Alan Dundes
I have a great advantage over many of my colleagues inasmuch as my students bring with them to class their own personal knowledge of national, regional, religious, ethnic, occupational, and family folklore traditions.::Alan Dundes
Future orientation is combined with a notion and expectation of progress, and nothing is impossible.::Alan Dundes
In the light of our culture, these are not unreasonable questions and tactics, but if once again, we try to see the lens through which we look, we can see that there is far too great an emphasis placed on the future.::Alan Dundes
If a student takes the whole series of my folklore courses including the graduate seminars, he or she should learn something about fieldwork, something about bibliography, something about how to carry out library research, and something about how to publish that research.::Alan Dundes
In the absence of the gold standard, there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation. There is no safe store of value.::Alan Greenspan
I have found no greater satisfaction than achieving success through honest dealing and strict adherence to the view that, for you to gain, those you deal with should gain as well.::Alan Greenspan
I was a good amateur but only an average professional. I soon realized that there was a limit to how far I could rise in the music business, so I left the band and enrolled at New York University.::Alan Greenspan
I was a fairly good amateur musician, and I was an average professional. But the one thing I saw was that the big band business was fading.::Alan Greenspan
History has not dealt kindly with the aftermath of protracted periods of low risk premiums.::Alan Greenspan
I've been in and out of Wall Street since 1949, and I've never seen the type of animosity between government and Wall Street. And I'm not sure where it comes from, but I suspect it's got to do with a general schism in this society which is really becoming ever more destructive.::Alan Greenspan
Any informed borrower is simply less vulnerable to fraud and abuse.::Alan Greenspan
To succeed, you will soon learn, as I did, the importance of a solid foundation in the basics of education - literacy, both verbal and numerical, and communication skills.::Alan Greenspan
An almost hysterical antagonism toward the gold standard is one issue which unites statists of all persuasions. They seem to sense... that gold and economic freedom are inseparable.::Alan Greenspan
Look, I'm very much in favor of tax cuts, but not with borrowed money. And the problem that we've gotten into in recent years is spending programs with borrowed money, tax cuts with borrowed money, and at the end of the day that proves disastrous. And my view is I don't think we can play subtle policy here.::Alan Greenspan
We need, in effect, to make the phantom 'lock-boxes' around the trust fund real.::Alan Greenspan
It's hard for me to think of others because I'm not particularly in sympathy with the music of this century.::Alan Hovhaness
I've always regarded nature as the clothing of God.::Alan Hovhaness
Marriage is nature's way of keeping us from fighting with strangers.::Alan King
Banks have a new image. Now you have 'a friend,' your friendly banker. If the banks are so friendly, how come they chain down the pens?::Alan King
If you want to read about love and marriage, you've got to buy two separate books.::Alan King
Time scoots along pretty fast when you grow up.::Alan Ladd
I've always had a great respect for the picture business. It's been good to me.::Alan Ladd
It's a funny thing about me. I don't have any interest in food most of the time now, although when I was a kid I was always hungry.::Alan Ladd
I'm working myself to death.::Alan Ladd
To give up the task of reforming society is to give up one's responsibility as a free man.::Alan Paton
Who knows for what we live, and struggle, and die? Wise men write many books, in words too hard to understand. But this, the purpose of our lives, the end of all our struggle, is beyond all human wisdom.::Alan Paton
You can measure a programmer's perspective by noting his attitude on the continuing vitality of FORTRAN.::Alan Perlis
In software systems it is often the early bird that makes the worm.::Alan Perlis
Computer Science is embarrassed by the computer.::Alan Perlis
I think it is inevitable that people program poorly. Training will not substantially help matters. We have to learn to live with it.::Alan Perlis
A year spent in artificial intelligence is enough to make one believe in God.::Alan Perlis
If your computer speaks English, it was probably made in Japan.::Alan Perlis
In computing, turning the obvious into the useful is a living definition of the word 'frustration'.::Alan Perlis
It goes against the grain of modern education to teach students to program. What fun is there to making plans, acquiring discipline, organizing thoughts, devoting attention to detail, and learning to be self critical.::Alan Perlis
I didn't mind studying. Obviously math and the physical science subjects interested me more than some of the more artistic subjects, but I think I was a pretty good student.::Alan Shepard
I think all of us certainly believed the statistics which said that probably 88% chance of mission success and maybe 96% chance of survival. And we were willing to take those odds.::Alan Shepard
Later, in the early teens, I used to ride my bike every Saturday morning to the nearest airport, ten miles away, push airplanes in and out of the hangars, and clean up the hangars.::Alan Shepard
It's a very sobering feeling to be up in space and realize that one's safety factor was determined by the lowest bidder on a government contract.::Alan Shepard
The pilot looked at his cues of attitude and speed and orientation and so on and responded as he would from the same cues in an airplane, but there was no way it flew the same. The simulators had showed us that.::Alan Shepard
You have to be there not for the fame and glory and recognition and being a page in a history book, but you have to be there because you believe your talent and ability can be applied effectively to operation of the spacecraft.::Alan Shepard
We worked with the engineers in the design and construction and testing phases in those various areas, then we would get back together at the end of the week and brief each other as to what had gone on.::Alan Shepard
I'd like to say I was smart enough to finish six grades in five years, but I think perhaps the teacher was just glad to get rid of me.::Alan Shepard
I must admit, maybe I am a piece of history after all.::Alan Shepard
Of course, in our grade school, in those days, there were no organized sports at all. We just went out and ran around the school yard for recess.::Alan Shepard
Science is a differential equation. Religion is a boundary condition.::Alan Turing
That's what so sad about a lot of modern music, in my opinion, so many young bands never stay around long enough to fulfill their ultimate promise. They only get halfway there or a quarter of the way there.::Alan Vega
We played in Texas about a year ago, at Emo's, the famous country and western club in Austin. And I figured, well, if I'm finally gonna die onstage, that's where it's going to be!::Alan Vega
But it was great, we sit in the same dressing room where, like, Johnny Cash sat and Willie Nelson and all those guys. That was in itself something amazing - I was on the same space these guys stood on, ya know?::Alan Vega
In known history, nobody has had such capacity for altering the universe than the people of the United States of America. And nobody has gone about it in such an aggressive way.::Alan Watts
But the attitude of faith is to let go, and become open to truth, whatever it might turn out to be.::Alan Watts
How is it possible that a being with such sensitive jewels as the eyes, such enchanted musical instruments as the ears, and such fabulous arabesque of nerves as the brain can experience itself anything less than a god.::Alan Watts
The reason we have poverty is that we have no imagination. There are a great many people accumulating what they think is vast wealth, but it's only money... they don't know how to enjoy it, because they have no imagination.::Alan Watts
You are that vast thing that you see far, far off with great telescopes.::Alan Watts
I have realized that the past and future are real illusions, that they exist in the present, which is what there is and all there is.::Alan Watts
The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance.::Alan Watts
Technology is destructive only in the hands of people who do not realize that they are one and the same process as the universe.::Alan Watts
So then, the relationship of self to other is the complete realization that loving yourself is impossible without loving everything defined as other than yourself.::Alan Watts
Faith is a state of openness or trust.::Alan Watts
No work or love will flourish out of guilt, fear, or hollowness of heart, just as no valid plans for the future can be made by those who have no capacity for living now.::Alan Watts
And the attitude of faith is the very opposite of clinging to belief, of holding on.::Alan Watts
To have faith is to trust yourself to the water. When you swim you don't grab hold of the water, because if you do you will sink and drown. Instead you relax, and float.::Alan Watts
You don't look out there for God, something in the sky, you look in you.::Alan Watts
Religion is not a department of life it is something that enters into the whole of it.::Alan Watts
Zen does not confuse spirituality with thinking about God while one is peeling potatoes. Zen spirituality is just to peel the potatoes.::Alan Watts
The religious idea of God cannot do full duty for the metaphysical infinity.::Alan Watts
But at any rate, the point is that God is what nobody admits to being, and everybody really is.::Alan Watts
No valid plans for the future can be made by those who have no capacity for living now.::Alan Watts
The difficulty for most of us in the modern world is that the old-fashioned idea of God has become incredible or implausible.::Alan Watts
In other words, a person who is fanatic in matters of religion, and clings to certain ideas about the nature of God and the universe, becomes a person who has no faith at all.::Alan Watts
But to me nothing - the negative, the empty - is exceedingly powerful.::Alan Watts
The style of God venerated in the church, mosque, or synagogue seems completely different from the style of the natural universe.::Alan Watts
Music is at once the product of feeling and knowledge, for it requires from its disciples, composers and performers alike, not only talent and enthusiasm, but also that knowledge and perception which are the result of protracted study and reflection.::Alban Berg
I can tell you, dearest friend, that if it became known how much friendship, love and a world of human and spiritual references I have smuggled into these three movements, the adherents of programme music - should there be any left - would go mad with joy.::Alban Berg
The best audience is intelligent, well-educated and a little drunk.::Alben W. Barkley
Most of the images of reality on which we base our actions are really based on vicarious experience.::Albert Bandura
People who believe they have the power to exercise some measure of control over their lives are healthier, more effective and more successful than those who lack faith in their ability to effect changes in their lives.::Albert Bandura
Everywhere among the English-speaking race criminal justice was rude, and punishments were barbarous but the tendency was to do away with special privileges and legal exemptions.::Albert Bushnell Hart
It is a kind of spiritual snobbery that makes people think they can be happy without money.::Albert Camus
The myth of unlimited production brings war in its train as inevitably as clouds announce a storm.::Albert Camus
A man's work is nothing but this slow trek to rediscover, through the detours of art, those two or three great and simple images in whose presence his heart first opened.::Albert Camus
The only real progress lies in learning to be wrong all alone.::Albert Camus
You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.::Albert Camus
We always deceive ourselves twice about the people we love - first to their advantage, then to their disadvantage.::Albert Camus
To abandon oneself to principles is really to die - and to die for an impossible love which is the contrary of love.::Albert Camus
It is normal to give away a little of one's life in order not to lose it all.::Albert Camus
All modern revolutions have ended in a reinforcement of the power of the State.::Albert Camus
To assert in any case that a man must be absolutely cut off from society because he is absolutely evil amounts to saying that society is absolutely good, and no-one in his right mind will believe this today.::Albert Camus
He who despairs of the human condition is a coward, but he who has hope for it is a fool.::Albert Camus
We get into the habit of living before acquiring the habit of thinking. In that race which daily hastens us towards death, the body maintains its irreparable lead.::Albert Camus
We used to wonder where war lived, what it was that made it so vile. And now we realize that we know where it lives... inside ourselves.::Albert Camus
Nothing is more despicable than respect based on fear.::Albert Camus
Your successes and happiness are forgiven you only if you generously consent to share them.::Albert Camus
To know oneself, one should assert oneself.::Albert Camus
Autumn is a second spring when every leaf is a flower.::Albert Camus
Retaliation is related to nature and instinct, not to law. Law, by definition, cannot obey the same rules as nature.::Albert Camus
To insure the adoration of a theorem for any length of time, faith is not enough, a police force is needed as well.::Albert Camus
We turn toward God only to obtain the impossible.::Albert Camus
The society based on production is only productive, not creative.::Albert Camus
Beauty is unbearable, drives us to despair, offering us for a minute the glimpse of an eternity that we should like to stretch out over the whole of time.::Albert Camus
We continue to shape our personality all our life. If we knew ourselves perfectly, we should die.::Albert Camus
When you have really exhausted an experience you always reverence and love it.::Albert Camus
In the depth of winter I finally learned that there was in me an invincible summer.::Albert Camus
To correct a natural indifference I was placed half-way between misery and the sun. Misery kept me from believing that all was well under the sun, and the sun taught me that history wasn't everything.::Albert Camus
How can sincerity be a condition of friendship? A taste for truth at any cost is a passion which spares nothing.::Albert Camus
A taste for truth at any cost is a passion which spares nothing.::Albert Camus

Until he extends his circle of compassion to include all living things, man will not himself find peace.::Albert Schweitzer

In June as many as a dozen species may burst their buds on a single day. No man can heed all of these anniversaries no man can ignore all of them.::Aldo Leopold

Harmony with land is like harmony with a friend, you cannot cherish his right hand and chop off his left.::Aldo Leopold
Dream in a pragmatic way.::Aldous Huxley

Experience teaches only the teachable.::Aldous Huxley

The most valuable of all education is the ability to make yourself do the thing you have to do, when it has to be done, whether you like it or not.::Aldous Huxley

De Sade is the one completely consistent and thoroughgoing revolutionary of history.::Aldous Huxley
From their experience or from the recorded experience of others (history), men learn only what their passions and their metaphysical prejudices allow them to learn.::Aldous Huxley
Perhaps it's good for one to suffer. Can an artist do anything if he's happy? Would he ever want to do anything? What is art, after all, but a protest against the horrible inclemency of life?::Aldous Huxley
Thought must be divided against itself before it can come to any knowledge of itself.::Aldous Huxley
Happiness is a hard master, particularly other people's happiness.::Aldous Huxley
Technological progress has merely provided us with more efficient means for going backwards.::Aldous Huxley
Experience is not what happens to you it's what you do with what happens to you.::Aldous Huxley

All gods are homemade, and it is we who pull their strings, and so, give them the power to pull ours.::Aldous Huxley
A democracy which makes or even effectively prepares for modern, scientific war must necessarily cease to be democratic. No country can be really well prepared for modern war unless it is governed by a tyrant, at the head of a highly trained and perfectly obedient bureaucracy.::Aldous Huxley
Like every man of sense and good feeling, I abominate work.::Aldous Huxley
You should hurry up and acquire the cigar habit. It's one of the major happinesses. And so much more lasting than love, so much less costly in emotional wear and tear.::Aldous Huxley
After silence, that which comes nearest to expressing the inexpressible is music.::Aldous Huxley

Science has explained nothing the more we know the more fantastic the world becomes and the profounder the surrounding darkness.::Aldous Huxley
It was one of those evenings when men feel that truth, goodness and beauty are one. In the morning, when they commit their discovery to paper, when others read it written there, it looks wholly ridiculous.::Aldous Huxley
That all men are equal is a proposition to which, at ordinary times, no sane human being has ever given his assent.::Aldous Huxley
An unexciting truth may be eclipsed by a thrilling lie.::Aldous Huxley
The secret of genius is to carry the spirit of the child into old age, which mean never losing your enthusiasm.::Aldous Huxley
What with making their way and enjoying what they have won, heroes have no time to think. But the sons of heroes - ah, they have all the necessary leisure.::Aldous Huxley
What is absurd and monstrous about war is that men who have no personal quarrel should be trained to murder one another in cold blood.::Aldous Huxley

The worst enemy of life, freedom and the common decencies is total anarchy their second worst enemy is total efficiency.::Aldous Huxley
Children are remarkable for their intelligence and ardor, for their curiosity, their intolerance of shams, the clarity and ruthlessness of their vision.::Aldous Huxley

You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you mad.::Aldous Huxley
Man approaches the unattainable truth through a succession of errors.::Aldous Huxley

A Shakespearean tragedy as so far considered may be called a story of exceptional calamity leading to the death of a man in high estate. But it is clearly much more than this, and we have now to regard it from another side.::Andrew Coyle Bradley
Shakespeare also introduces the supernatural into some of his tragedies he introduces ghosts, and witches who have supernatural knowledge.::Andrew Coyle Bradley

Well, religion has been passed down through the years by stories people tell around the campfire. Stories about God, stories about love. Stories about good spirits and evil spirits.::Andrew Greeley

Death is a distant rumor to the young.::Andy Rooney
The federal government has sponsored research that has produced a tomato that is perfect in every respect, except that you can't eat it. We should make every effort to make sure this disease, often referred to as 'progress', doesn't spread.::Andy Rooney

The average dog is a nicer person than the average person.::Andy Rooney
I don't think the government is out to get me or help someone else get me but it wouldn't surprise me if they were out to sell me something or help someone else sell me something. I mean, why else would the Census Bureau want to know my telephone number?::Andy Rooney
All men are not created equal but should be treated as though they were under the law.::Andy Rooney

They always say time changes things, but you actually have to change them yourself.::Andy Warhol
I'm the type who'd be happy not going anywhere as long as I was sure I knew exactly what was happening at the places I wasn't going to. I'm the type who'd like to sit home and watch every party that I'm invited to on a monitor in my bedroom.::Andy Warhol

I had a lot of dates but I decided to stay home and dye my eyebrows.::Andy Warhol

In the future everyone will be famous for 15 minutes.::Andy Warhol
Making money is art and working is art and good business is the best art.::Andy Warhol

My mother was against me being an actress - until I introduced her to Frank Sinatra.::Angie Dickinson

Accountability in friendship is the equivalent of love without strategy.::Anita Brookner

Great passions, my dear, don't exist: they're liars fantasies. What do exist are little loves that may last for a short or a longer while.::Anna Magnani
But if we learn to think of it as anticipation, as learning, as growing, if we think of the time we spend waiting for the big things of life as an opportunity instead of a passing of time, what wonderful horizons open out!::Anna Neagle
But the important thing about learning to wait, I feel sure, is to know what you are waiting for.::Anna Neagle
The time I had waited probably made the difference between success and failure.::Anna Neagle

Think of all the beauty still left around you and be happy.::Anne Frank
How true Daddy's words were when he said: all children must look after their own upbringing. Parents can only give good advice or put them on the right paths, but the final forming of a person's character lies in their own hands.::Anne Frank
In spite of everything I still believe that people are really good at heart. I simply can't build up my hopes on a foundation consisting of confusion, misery and death.::Anne Frank
It's really a wonder that I haven't dropped all my ideals, because they seem so absurd and impossible to carry out. Yet I keep them, because in spite of everything I still believe that people are really good at heart.::Anne Frank
I don't think of all the misery but of the beauty that still remains.::Anne Frank

I keep my ideals, because in spite of everything I still believe that people are really good at heart.::Anne Frank
Whoever is happy will make others happy too.::Anne Frank
And finally I twist my heart round again, so that the bad is on the outside and the good is on the inside, and keep on trying to find a way of becoming what I would so like to be, and could be, if there weren't any other people living in the world.::Anne Frank
Despite everything, I believe that people are really good at heart.::Anne Frank
Parents can only give good advice or put them on the right paths, but the final forming of a person's character lies in their own hands.::Anne Frank
I simply can't build my hopes on a foundation of confusion, misery and death... I think... peace and tranquillity will return again.::Anne Frank
I live in a crazy time.::Anne Frank
I must uphold my ideals, for perhaps the time will come when I shall be able to carry them out.::Anne Frank

The wave of the future is coming and there is no fighting it.::Anne Morrow Lindbergh

Arranging a bowl of flowers in the morning can give a sense of quiet in a crowded day - like writing a poem or saying a prayer.::Anne Morrow Lindbergh
Grief can't be shared. Everyone carries it alone. His own burden in his own way.::Anne Morrow Lindbergh
I do not believe that sheer suffering teaches. If suffering alone taught, all the world would be wise, since everyone suffers. To suffering must be added mourning, understanding, patience, love, openness and the willingness to remain vulnerable.::Anne Morrow Lindbergh
Good communication is just as stimulating as black coffee, and just as hard to sleep after.::Anne Morrow Lindbergh
Men kick friendship around like a football, but it doesn't seem to crack. Women treat it like glass and it goes to pieces.::Anne Morrow Lindbergh

The most exhausting thing in life is being insincere.::Anne Morrow Lindbergh
When the wedding march sounds the resolute approach, the clock no longer ticks, it tolls the hour. The figures in the aisle are no longer individuals, they symbolize the human race.::Anne Morrow Lindbergh
By and large, mothers and housewives are the only workers who do not have regular time off. They are the great vacationless class.::Anne Morrow Lindbergh
The only real security is not in owning or possessing, not in demanding or expecting, not in hoping, even. Security in a relationship lies neither in looking back to what it was, nor forward to what it might be, but living in the present and accepting it as it is now.::Anne Morrow Lindbergh
I have been overcome by the beauty and richness of our life together, those early mornings setting out, those evenings gleaming with rivers and lakes below us, still holding the last light.::Anne Morrow Lindbergh
America, which has the most glorious present still existing in the world today, hardly stops to enjoy it, in her insatiable appetite for the future.::Anne Morrow Lindbergh
It takes as much courage to have tried and failed as it does to have tried and succeeded.::Anne Morrow Lindbergh
Only in growth, reform, and change, paradoxically enough, is true security to be found.::Anne Morrow Lindbergh
I think it's a terrible thing to write and not enjoy it. It's a sad thing. But of course a lot of people do work because they need to eat. And we all need to eat, but that's not the only reason to work. You couldn't have paid me not to write.::Anne Perry
A woman whose smile is open and whose expression is glad has a kind of beauty no matter what she wears.::Anne Roiphe
We also have to make sure our children know the history of women. Tell them the rotten truth: It wasn't always possible for women to become doctors or managers or insurance people. Let them be armed with a true picture of the way we want it to be.::Anne Roiphe
Death's in the good-bye.::Anne Sexton
It doesn't matter who my father was it matters who I remember he was.::Anne Sexton
Good communication is as stimulating as black coffee, and just as hard.::Anne Spencer
A poem might be defined as thinking about feelings - about human feelings and frailties.::Anne Stevenson
I have always made my own rules, in poetry as in life - though I have tried of late to cooperate more with my family. I do, however, believe that without order or pattern poetry is useless.::Anne Stevenson
Yes, I do often write poems from the mind, but I hope I don't ignore feelings and emotions.::Anne Stevenson
Each word bears its weight, so you have to read my poems quite slowly.::Anne Stevenson
Poets should ignore most criticism and get on with making poetry.::Anne Stevenson
I'm not really quiet or shy. Ask any of my friends! But I always ground my poetry in life itself. Poetry is an art of language, though, so I am always aware of every word's meaning, or multiple meanings.::Anne Stevenson
I don't like poetry that just slaps violent words on a canvas, as it were.::Anne Stevenson
I did know Ted Hughes and I partly wrote the book to explain to myself and others the complexities of a marriage that was for six years wonderfully productive of poetry and then ended in tragedy.::Anne Stevenson
I dislike literary jargon and never use it. Criticism has only one function and that is to help readers read and understand literature. It is not a science, it is an aid to art.::Anne Stevenson
My heart is singing for joy this morning! A miracle has happened! The light of understanding has shone upon my little pupil's mind, and behold, all things are changed!::Anne Sullivan
I am beginning to suspect all elaborate and special systems of education. They seem to me to be built up on the supposition that every child is a kind of idiot who must be taught to think.::Anne Sullivan
Children require guidance and sympathy far more than instruction.::Anne Sullivan
We all like stories that make us cry. It's so nice to feel sad when you've nothing in particular to feel sad about.::Anne Sullivan
It's a great mistake, I think, to put children off with falsehoods and nonsense, when their growing powers of observation and discrimination excite in them a desire to know about things.::Anne Sullivan
I have thought about it a great deal, and the more I think, the more certain I am that obedience is the gateway through which knowledge, yes, and love, too, enter the mind of the child.::Anne Sullivan
Good health is not something we can buy. However, it can be an extremely valuable savings account.::Anne Wilson Schaef
I realize that humor isn't for everyone. It's only for people who want to have fun, enjoy life, and feel alive.::Anne Wilson Schaef
Healthy people live with their world.::Anne Wilson Schaef
Whole areas of knowledge and information have been defined into nonexistence because the system cannot know, understand, control, or measure them.::Anne Wilson Schaef
There are so many ways to heal. Arrogance may have a place in technology, but not in healing. I need to get out of my own way if I am to heal.::Anne Wilson Schaef
Looking after my health today gives me a better hope for tomorrow.::Anne Wilson Schaef
Refusal to believe until proof is given is a rational position denial of all outside of our own limited experience is absurd.::Annie Besant
No philosophy, no religion, has ever brought so glad a message to the world as this good news of Atheism.::Annie Besant
Teaching man his relatively small sphere in the creation, it also encourages him by its lessons of the unity of Nature and shows him that his power of comprehension allies him with the great intelligence over-reaching all.::Annie Jump Cannon

Photography is more than a medium for factual communication of ideas. It is a creative art.::Ansel Adams
It is horrifying that we have to fight our own government to save the environment.::Ansel Adams
There are worlds of experience beyond the world of the aggressive man, beyond history, and beyond science. The moods and qualities of nature and the revelations of great art are equally difficult to define we can grasp them only in the depths of our perceptive spirit.::Ansel Adams
A good photograph is knowing where to stand.::Ansel Adams
There is nothing worse than a sharp image of a fuzzy concept.::Ansel Adams
In wisdom gathered over time I have found that every experience is a form of exploration.::Ansel Adams
Myths and creeds are heroic struggles to comprehend the truth in the world.::Ansel Adams
Yosemite Valley, to me, is always a sunrise, a glitter of green and golden wonder in a vast edifice of stone and space.::Ansel Adams
Millions of men have lived to fight, build palaces and boundaries, shape destinies and societies but the compelling force of all times has been the force of originality and creation profoundly affecting the roots of human spirit.::Ansel Adams
A great photograph is one that fully expresses what one feels, in the deepest sense, about what is being photographed.::Ansel Adams
Sometimes I do get to places just when God's ready to have somebody click the shutter.::Ansel Adams
Americans will listen, but they do not care to read. War and Peace must wait for the leisure of retirement, which never really comes: meanwhile it helps to furnish the living room.::Anthony Burgess
Women thrive on novelty and are easy meat for the commerce of fashion. Men prefer old pipes and torn jackets.::Anthony Burgess
Laugh and the world laughs with you, snore and you sleep alone.::Anthony Burgess
Early One Morning takes time and, I mean, all things like that I felt were very important.::Anthony Caro
There's not a good poet I know who has not at the beck and call of his memory a vast quantity of poetry that composes his mental library.::Anthony Hecht
Poetry operates by hints and dark suggestions. It is full of secrets and hidden formulae, like a witch's brew.::Anthony Hecht
A lot of the fun lies in trying to penetrate the mystery and this is best done by saying over the lines to yourself again and again, till they pass through the stage of sounding like nonsense, and finally return to a full sense that had at first escaped notice.::Anthony Hecht
I wish you would read a little poetry sometimes. Your ignorance cramps my conversation.::Anthony Hope
Telling the truth to people who misunderstand you is generally promoting a falsehood, isn't it?::Anthony Hope
I came here in 1974 to do a play, and then I went to L.A. I really like living in America. I feel more at home here than anywhere else.::Anthony Hopkins
In the theatre, people talk. Talk, talk until the cows come home about journeys of discovery and about what Hazlitt thought of a line of Shakespeare. I can't stand it.::Anthony Hopkins
I've been composing music all my life and if I'd been clever enough at school I would like to have gone to music college.::Anthony Hopkins
I'm married. My wife, Stella - a beautiful woman. She's brought a lot of peace to my life, a lot of wisdom.::Anthony Hopkins
My life turned out to be beyond my greatest dreams.::Anthony Hopkins
I love life because what more is there?::Anthony Hopkins
We all dream. We dream vividly, depending on our nature. Our existence is beyond our explanation, whether we believe in God or we have religion or we're atheist.::Anthony Hopkins
Why love if losing hurts so much? I have no answers anymore only the life I have lived. The pain now is part of the happiness then.::Anthony Hopkins
I'm one of the slowest drivers on the road. I mosey along. If you're doing anything too fast, including living life too fast, that creates sudden death. If I have to be somewhere on time, I make sure I leave early enough.::Anthony Hopkins
We are dying from overthinking. We are slowly killing ourselves by thinking about everything. Think. Think. Think. You can never trust the human mind anyway. It's a death trap.::Anthony Hopkins
I've got a great sense of humor.::Anthony Hopkins
I have no interest in Shakespeare and all that British nonsense... I just wanted to get famous and all the rest is hogwash.::Anthony Hopkins
Well, everyone likes movies when they're a little kid.::Anthony Hopkins
My father was grounded, a very meat-and-potatoes man. He was a baker.::Anthony Hopkins

It is only when we no longer compulsively need someone that we can have a real relationship with them.::Anthony Storr

If we did not look to marriage as the principal source of happiness, fewer marriages would end in tears.::Anthony Storr
Success is the necessary misfortune of life, but it is only to the very unfortunate that it comes early.::Anthony Trollope
They who do not understand that a man may be brought to hope that which of all things is the most grievous to him, have not observed with sufficient closeness the perversity of the human mind.::Anthony Trollope

Neither money nor position can atone to me for low birth.::Anthony Trollope
There is no royal road to learning no short cut to the acquirement of any art.::Anthony Trollope
It may almost be a question whether such wisdom as many of us have in our mature years has not come from the dying out of the power of temptation, rather than as the results of thought and resolution.::Anthony Trollope
A man's love, till it has been chastened and fastened by the feeling of duty which marriage brings with it, is instigated mainly by the difficulty of pursuit.::Anthony Trollope
What is there that money will not do?::Anthony Trollope
I shall begin my march for Camp tomorrow morning. It was not in my power to move until I could procure shoes for the troops almost barefoot.::Anthony Wayne
It is a great mystery that though the human heart longs for Truth, in which alone it finds liberation and delight, the first reaction of human beings to Truth is one of hostility and fear!::Anthony de Mello
These things will destroy the human race: politics without principle, progress without compassion, wealth without work, learning without silence, religion without fearlessness and worship without awareness.::Anthony de Mello
Quarrels often arise in marriages when the bridal gifts are excessive.::Antisthenes
There are only two people who can tell you the truth about yourself - an enemy who has lost his temper and a friend who loves you dearly.::Antisthenes
As iron is eaten away by rust, so the envious are consumed by their own passion.::Antisthenes
The most useful piece of learning for the uses of life is to unlearn what is untrue.::Antisthenes
Not to unlearn what you have learned is the most necessary kind of learning.::Antisthenes
Man spends his life in reasoning on the past, in complaining of the present, in fearing future.::Antoine de Rivarol
Life has meaning only if one barters it day by day for something other than itself.::Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry
Only the unknown frightens men. But once a man has faced the unknown, that terror becomes the known.::Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry
The meaning of things lies not in the things themselves, but in our attitude towards them.::Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry
'Men have forgotten this truth,' said the fox. 'But you must not forget it. You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed.'::Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry
A rock pile ceases to be a rock pile the moment a single man contemplates it, bearing within him the image of a cathedral.::Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry
The time for action is now. It's never too late to do something.::Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry
We say nothing essential about the cathedral when we speak of its stones. We say nothing essential about Man when we seek to define him by the qualities of men.::Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry
Love does not consist in gazing at each other, but in looking outward together in the same direction.::Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry
True happiness comes from the joy of deeds well done, the zest of creating things new.::Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry
The machine does not isolate man from the great problems of nature but plunges him more deeply into them.::Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry
A civilization is built on what is required of men, not on that which is provided for them.::Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry
I know but one freedom, and that is the freedom of the mind.::Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry
Once men are caught up in an event, they cease to be afraid. Only the unknown frightens men.::Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry
Tell me who admires and loves you, and I will tell you who you are.::Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry
One can be a brother only in something. Where there is no tie that binds men, men are not united but merely lined up.::Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry
I have no right, by anything I do or say, to demean a human being in his own eyes. What matters is not what I think of him it is what he thinks of himself. To undermine a man's self-respect is a sin.::Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry
A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.::Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry
War is not an adventure. It is a disease. It is like typhus.::Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry
If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.::Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry
Charity never humiliated him who profited from it, nor ever bound him by the chains of gratitude, since it was not to him but to God that the gift was made.::Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry

A chief is a man who assumes responsibility. He says 'I was beaten,' he does not say 'My men were beaten.'::Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry
A civilization is a heritage of beliefs, customs, and knowledge slowly accumulated in the course of centuries, elements difficult at times to justify by logic, but justifying themselves as paths when they lead somewhere, since they open up for man his inner distance.::Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry
To judge between good or bad, between successful and unsuccessful would take the eye of a God.::Anton Chekhov
We learn about life not from plusses alone, but from minuses as well.::Anton Chekhov
Any idiot can face a crisis - it's day to day living that wears you out.::Anton Chekhov
Knowledge is of no value unless you put it into practice.::Anton Chekhov
The thirst for powerful sensations takes the upper hand both over fear and over compassion for the grief of others.::Anton Chekhov

Let us learn to appreciate there will be times when the trees will be bare, and look forward to the time when we may pick the fruit.::Anton Chekhov
Love, friendship and respect do not unite people as much as a common hatred for something.::Anton Chekhov
There is nothing new in art except talent.::Anton Chekhov
Money, like vodka, turns a person into an eccentric.::Anton Chekhov
When you're thirsty and it seems that you could drink the entire ocean that's faith when you start to drink and finish only a glass or two that's science.::Anton Chekhov
The wealthy are always surrounded by hangers-on science and art are as well.::Anton Chekhov
No matter how corrupt and unjust a convict may be, he loves fairness more than anything else. If the people placed over him are unfair, from year to year he lapses into an embittered state characterized by an extreme lack of faith.::Anton Chekhov
Faith is an aptitude of the spirit. It is, in fact, a talent: you must be born with it.::Anton Chekhov
We shall find peace. We shall hear angels, we shall see the sky sparkling with diamonds.::Anton Chekhov
Doctors are just the same as lawyers the only difference is that lawyers merely rob you, whereas doctors rob you and kill you too.::Anton Chekhov
Medicine is my lawful wife and literature my mistress when I get tired of one, I spend the night with the other.::Anton Chekhov
You must trust and believe in people or life becomes impossible.::Anton Chekhov
Life does not agree with philosophy: There is no happiness that is not idleness, and only what is useless is pleasurable.::Anton Chekhov
When an actor has money he doesn't send letters, he sends telegrams.::Anton Chekhov
One must be a god to be able to tell successes from failures without making a mistake.::Anton Chekhov
I think there's a tremendous split between people who've been through a war and people who haven't.::Antonia Fraser
I think there has been a great deal of valuable revisionism in women's history.::Antonia Fraser
My advantage as a woman and a human being has been in having a mother who believed strongly in women's education. She was an early undergraduate at Oxford, and her own mother was a doctor.::Antonia Fraser
Written poetry is worth reading once, and then should be destroyed. Let the dead poets make way for others.::Antonin Artaud
I myself spent nine years in an insane asylum and I never had the obsession of suicide, but I know that each conversation with a psychiatrist, every morning at the time of his visit, made me want to hang myself, realizing that I would not be able to cut his throat.::Antonin Artaud
If we're picking people to draw out of their own conscience and experience a 'new' Constitution, we should not look principally for good lawyers. We should look to people who agree with us. When we are in that mode, you realize we have rendered the Constitution useless.::Antonin Scalia
In a big family the first child is kind of like the first pancake. If it's not perfect, that's okay, there are a lot more coming along.::Antonin Scalia
If you think aficionados of a living Constitution want to bring you flexibility, think again. You think the death penalty is a good idea? Persuade your fellow citizens to adopt it. You want a right to abortion? Persuade your fellow citizens and enact it. That's flexibility.::Antonin Scalia
Happiness is realizing that nothing is too important.::Antonio Gala
My practicality consists in this, in the knowledge that if you beat your head against the wall it is your head which breaks and not the wall - that is my strength, my only strength.::Antonio Gramsci
I'm a pessimist because of intelligence, but an optimist because of will.::Antonio Gramsci
To tell the truth is revolutionary.::Antonio Gramsci
Flowers are without hope. Because hope is tomorrow and flowers have no tomorrow.::Antonio Porchia

One lives in the hope of becoming a memory.::Antonio Porchia
Those who gave away their wings are sad not to see them fly.::Antonio Porchia
There is no happiness for people at the expense of other people.::Anwar Sadat
Fear is, I believe, a most effective tool in destroying the soul of an individual - and the soul of a people.::Anwar Sadat
Russians can give you arms but only the United States can give you a solution.::Anwar Sadat
Peace is much more precious than a piece of land... let there be no more wars.::Anwar Sadat
There can be hope only for a society which acts as one big family, not as many separate ones.::Anwar Sadat
He that knew all that learning ever writ, Knew only this - that he knew nothing yet.::Aphra Behn
Nothing is more capable of troubling our reason, and consuming our health, than secret notions of jealousy in solitude.::Aphra Behn
Faith, sir, we are here today, and gone tomorrow.::Aphra Behn
Love ceases to be a pleasure when it ceases to be a secret.::Aphra Behn
Each moment of a happy lover's hour is worth an age of dull and common life.::Aphra Behn
Nature never makes any blunders, when she makes a fool she means it.::Archibald Alexander
Journalism wishes to tell what it is that has happened everywhere as though the same things had happened for every man. Poetry wishes to say what it is like for any man to be himself in the presence of a particular occurrence as though only he were alone there.::Archibald MacLeish
Freedom is the right to one's dignity as a man.::Archibald MacLeish
Conventional wisdom notwithstanding, there is no reason either in football or in poetry why the two should not meet in a man's life if he has the weight and cares about the words.::Archibald MacLeish
Journalism is concerned with events, poetry with feelings. Journalism is concerned with the look of the world, poetry with the feel of the world.::Archibald MacLeish
In rap music, even though the element of poetry is very strong, so is the element of the drum, the implication of the dance. Without the beat, its commercial value would certainly be more tenuous.::Archie Shepp
Negro music and culture are intrinsically improvisational, existential. Nothing is sacred. After a decade, a musical idea, no matter how innovative, is threatened.::Archie Shepp
Let who will boast their courage in the field, I find but little safety from my shield, Nature's, not honour's law we must obey: This made me cast my useless shield away.::Archilochus
Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.::Archimedes
The ongoing conflict between us has caused heavy suffering to both peoples. The future can and must be different. Both our peoples are destined to live together side by side, on this small piece of land. This reality we cannot change.::Ariel Sharon
If there will be a serious Palestinian prime minister who makes a 100 percent effort to end terrorism, then we can have peace. Each side has to take steps. If terror continues, there will not be an independent Palestinian state. Israel will not accept it, if terror continues.::Ariel Sharon
The strength that I have comes from irrigating the citrus plantation, ploughing in the vineyard, guarding the melon fields at night. I believe that's what gave me the strength.::Ariel Sharon
To our Palestinian neighbours, I assure you that we have a genuine intention to respect your right to live independently and in dignity. I have already said that Israel has no desire to continue to govern over you and control your fate.::Ariel Sharon
To the citizens of Israel, I say: we have passed difficult years, faced the most painful experiences and overcame them. The future lies before us. We are required to take difficult and controversial steps, but we must not miss the opportunity to try to achieve what we have wished for, for so many years: security, tranquillity and peace.::Ariel Sharon
I am 73 years old. I've seen everything. I've met the kings, the queens, the presidents, I've been around the world. I have one thing that I would like to do: to try to reach peace.::Ariel Sharon
I was born on a farm. My strength has nothing to do with political apparatus. I get my strength from nature, from flowers.::Ariel Sharon
For me, peace should provide security to the Jewish people.::Ariel Sharon
I don't think I have accomplished what I still have to accomplish. There is one thing that I would like to do, and that's to bring security and peace to the Jewish people.::Ariel Sharon
We extend our hand towards peace. Our people are committed to peace. We know that peace entails painful compromise for both sides.::Ariel Sharon
As one who participated in all the wars of the state of Israel, I saw the horror of wars. I saw the fear of wars. I saw my best friends being killed in battles. I was seriously injured twice.::Ariel Sharon
Like all Israelis, I yearn for peace. I see the utmost importance in taking all possible steps that will lead to a solution of the conflict with the Palestinians.::Ariel Sharon
Peace should provide security. It should be durable. I'm ready to go far in making painful concessions. But there is one thing I will never make any concessions on and that's the security of the Israeli citizens and the very existence of the state of Israel. The Palestinians are losing time.::Ariel Sharon
My strength never came from political echelons, it came from the family. And from the fields and the lands and the flowers and everything I see there. My strength came from there.::Ariel Sharon
The sad and horrible conclusion is that no one cared that Jews were being murdered... This is the Jewish lesson of the Holocaust and this is the lesson which Auschwitz taught us.::Ariel Sharon
I cannot say that the attitude of the United Nations always is for the Israeli attitude. Israel, I think, has been under severe attacks by members of the United Nations many times.::Ariel Sharon
But there's one thing we are not going to compromise at all: when it comes to security of Israeli citizens and the State of Israel, there are not going to be any compromises - not now and not in the future.::Ariel Sharon
A man may learn wisdom even from a foe.::Aristophanes
Let each man exercise the art he knows.::Aristophanes
Your lost friends are not dead, but gone before, advanced a stage or two upon that road which you must travel in the steps they trod.::Aristophanes
Why, I'd like nothing better than to achieve some bold adventure, worthy of our trip.::Aristophanes
The energy of the mind is the essence of life.::Aristotle
Men are swayed more by fear than by reverence.::Aristotle
We praise a man who feels angry on the right grounds and against the right persons and also in the right manner at the right moment and for the right length of time.::Aristotle
In a democracy the poor will have more power than the rich, because there are more of them, and the will of the majority is supreme.::Aristotle
Men acquire a particular quality by constantly acting in a particular way.::Aristotle
Good habits formed at youth make all the difference.::Aristotle
Youth is easily deceived because it is quick to hope.::Aristotle
All human actions have one or more of these seven causes: chance, nature, compulsions, habit, reason, passion, desire.::Aristotle
What it lies in our power to do, it lies in our power not to do.::Aristotle
All men by nature desire knowledge.::Aristotle
Therefore, the good of man must be the end of the science of politics.::Aristotle
For as the eyes of bats are to the blaze of day, so is the reason in our soul to the things which are by nature most evident of all.::Aristotle
Man is by nature a political animal.::Aristotle
At his best, man is the noblest of all animals separated from law and justice he is the worst.::Aristotle
Love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies.::Aristotle
Change in all things is sweet.::Aristotle
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and choice, is thought to aim at some good and for this reason the good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things aim.::Aristotle
The generality of men are naturally apt to be swayed by fear rather than reverence, and to refrain from evil rather because of the punishment that it brings than because of its own foulness.::Aristotle
It is Homer who has chiefly taught other poets the art of telling lies skillfully.::Aristotle
Fear is pain arising from the anticipation of evil.::Aristotle
Quality is not an act, it is a habit.::Aristotle
There is no great genius without a mixture of madness.::Aristotle
Wit is educated insolence.::Aristotle
Wishing to be friends is quick work, but friendship is a slow ripening fruit.::Aristotle
Education is an ornament in prosperity and a refuge in adversity.::Aristotle
It is best to rise from life as from a banquet, neither thirsty nor drunken.::Aristotle
It is clearly better that property should be private, but the use of it common and the special business of the legislator is to create in men this benevolent disposition.::Aristotle
In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous.::Aristotle
I have gained this from philosophy: that I do without being commanded what others do only from fear of the law.::Aristotle
Men create gods after their own image, not only with regard to their form but with regard to their mode of life.::Aristotle
Courage is a mean with regard to fear and confidence.::Aristotle
The roots of education are bitter, but the fruit is sweet.::Aristotle
The aim of art is to represent not the outward appearance of things, but their inward significance.::Aristotle
Excellence, then, is a state concerned with choice, lying in a mean, relative to us, this being determined by reason and in the way in which the man of practical wisdom would determine it.::Aristotle
Bad men are full of repentance.::Aristotle
Excellence is an art won by training and habituation. We do not act rightly because we have virtue or excellence, but we rather have those because we have acted rightly. We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.::Aristotle
Hope is the dream of a waking man.::Aristotle
Different men seek after happiness in different ways and by different means, and so make for themselves different modes of life and forms of government.::Aristotle
Hope is a waking dream.::Aristotle
Homer has taught all other poets the art of telling lies skillfully.::Aristotle
A sense is what has the power of receiving into itself the sensible forms of things without the matter, in the way in which a piece of wax takes on the impress of a signet-ring without the iron or gold.::Aristotle
To run away from trouble is a form of cowardice and, while it is true that the suicide braves death, he does it not for some noble object but to escape some ill.::Aristotle
Hence poetry is something more philosophic and of graver import than history, since its statements are rather of the nature of universals, whereas those of history are singulars.::Aristotle
He who can be, and therefore is, another's, and he who participates in reason enough to apprehend, but not to have, is a slave by nature.::Aristotle
He who is unable to live in society, or who has no need because he is sufficient for himself, must be either a beast or a god.::Aristotle
He who hath many friends hath none.::Aristotle
He who is to be a good ruler must have first been ruled.::Aristotle
Democracy is when the indigent, and not the men of property, are the rulers.::Aristotle
If liberty and equality, as is thought by some, are chiefly to be found in democracy, they will be best attained when all persons alike share in government to the utmost.::Aristotle
A tyrant must put on the appearance of uncommon devotion to religion. Subjects are less apprehensive of illegal treatment from a ruler whom they consider god-fearing and pious. On the other hand, they do less easily move against him, believing that he has the gods on his side.::Aristotle
The state comes into existence for the sake of life and continues to exist for the sake of good life.::Aristotle
What is a friend? A single soul dwelling in two bodies.::Aristotle
If one way be better than another, that you may be sure is nature's way.::Aristotle
The one exclusive sign of thorough knowledge is the power of teaching.::Aristotle
Courage is the first of human qualities because it is the quality which guarantees the others.::Aristotle

The best friend is the man who in wishing me well wishes it for my sake.::Aristotle
Bashfulness is an ornament to youth, but a reproach to old age.::Aristotle
Thou wilt find rest from vain fancies if thou doest every act in life as though it were thy last.::Aristotle
Nature does nothing in vain.::Aristotle
In poverty and other misfortunes of life, true friends are a sure refuge. The young they keep out of mischief to the old they are a comfort and aid in their weakness, and those in the prime of life they incite to noble deeds.::Aristotle
Democracy arises out of the notion that those who are equal in any respect are equal in all respects because men are equally free, they claim to be absolutely equal.::Aristotle
Education is the best provision for old age.::Aristotle
The secret to humor is surprise.::Aristotle
Jealousy is both reasonable and belongs to reasonable men, while envy is base and belongs to the base, for the one makes himself get good things by jealousy, while the other does not allow his neighbour to have them through envy.::Aristotle
Perfect friendship is the friendship of men who are good, and alike in excellence for these wish well alike to each other qua good, and they are good in themselves.::Aristotle
Politicians also have no leisure, because they are always aiming at something beyond political life itself, power and glory, or happiness.::Aristotle
The virtue of justice consists in moderation, as regulated by wisdom.::Aristotle
It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.::Aristotle
Anybody can become angry - that is easy, but to be angry with the right person and to the right degree and at the right time and for the right purpose, and in the right way - that is not within everybody's power and is not easy.::Aristotle
It is unbecoming for young men to utter maxims.::Aristotle
Whether if soul did not exist time would exist or not, is a question that may fairly be asked for if there cannot be someone to count there cannot be anything that can be counted, so that evidently there cannot be number for number is either what has been, or what can be, counted.::Aristotle
Personal beauty is a greater recommendation than any letter of reference.::Aristotle
For though we love both the truth and our friends, piety requires us to honor the truth first.::Aristotle
The moral virtues, then, are produced in us neither by nature nor against nature. Nature, indeed, prepares in us the ground for their reception, but their complete formation is the product of habit.::Aristotle
Friendship is a single soul dwelling in two bodies.::Aristotle
Piety requires us to honor truth above our friends.::Aristotle
We make war that we may live in peace.::Aristotle
The wise man does not expose himself needlessly to danger, since there are few things for which he cares sufficiently but he is willing, in great crises, to give even his life - knowing that under certain conditions it is not worthwhile to live.::Aristotle
For one swallow does not make a summer, nor does one day and so too one day, or a short time, does not make a man blessed and happy.::Aristotle
You will never do anything in this world without courage. It is the greatest quality of the mind next to honor.::Aristotle
Friendship is essentially a partnership.::Aristotle
The least initial deviation from the truth is multiplied later a thousandfold.::Aristotle

But if nothing but soul, or in soul mind, is qualified to count, it is impossible for there to be time unless there is soul, but only that of which time is an attribute, i.e. if change can exist without soul.::Aristotle
The ultimate value of life depends upon awareness and the power of contemplation rather than upon mere survival.::Aristotle
Poetry is finer and more philosophical than history for poetry expresses the universal, and history only the particular.::Aristotle

A great city is not to be confounded with a populous one.::Aristotle
We must free ourselves of the hope that the sea will ever rest. We must learn to sail in high winds.::Aristotle Onassis
If women didn't exist, all the money in the world would have no meaning.::Aristotle Onassis
To succeed in business it is necessary to make others see things as you see them.::Aristotle Onassis
After a certain point, money is meaningless. It ceases to be the goal. The game is what counts.::Aristotle Onassis
It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light.::Aristotle Onassis
The secret of business is to know something that nobody else knows.::Aristotle Onassis
Americans' addiction to sports, with the NFL at the top, is based on the excitement generated by the potential for the unexpected great play which can only happen with honest competition from great athletes.::Arlen Specter
My mother, Lillie Specter, was an angel and totally uninterested in politics.::Arlen Specter
There's nothing more important than our good health - that's our principal capital asset.::Arlen Specter
If we had pursued what President Nixon declared in 1970 as the war on cancer, we would have cured many strains. I think Jack Kemp would be alive today. And that research has saved or prolonged many lives, including mine.::Arlen Specter
Pennsylvania is a very tough state people don't last long in Pennsylvania politics.::Arlen Specter
But one way or another, judges perform a very vital function in our society. They have a risky job and they are entitled to security.::Arlen Specter
American credibility in the war on terrorism depends on a strong stand against all terrorist acts, whether committed by foe or friend.::Arlen Specter
The fundamental purpose of government is to protect its citizens.::Arlen Specter
My father was an immigrant who literally walked across Europe to get out of Russia. He fought in World War I. He was wounded in action. My father was a great success even though he never had money. He was a very determined man, a great role model.::Arlen Specter
It's inspirational to see someone who is dying smile.::Arlen Specter
There is no higher value in our society than integrity.::Arlen Specter
If you are going to have to play defense all the time, you cannot have the kind of ingenuity, assertiveness, independence, and intelligence which is what has made our country strong.::Arlen Specter
Strong advocacy for education, health care and worker safety will be indispensable if they are to get their fair share of President Bush's austere budget for the next fiscal year.::Arlen Specter
I am very much opposed to abortion personally. But I don't think it is the government's rule.::Arlen Specter
People in government and public life are being kicked around at a high rate of speed.::Arlen Specter

But inspiration? - That's when you come home from abroad and are asked: Well, have you found inspiration? - and fortunately you haven't. But the impressions sink in, of course, and may emerge later: None of us has invented the house that was done many thousands of years ago.::Arne Jacobsen
The primary factor is proportions.::Arne Jacobsen
If architecture had nothing to do with art, it would be astonishingly easy to build houses, but the architect's task - his most difficult task - is always that of selecting.::Arne Jacobsen
I don't see that any buildings should be excluded from the term architecture, as long as they are done properly.::Arne Jacobsen
If a building becomes architecture, then it is art.::Arne Jacobsen
When I travel, I draw and paint sketches which is great fun. And as long as you are fully aware that it has nothing to do with actual art, I think that's all right.::Arne Jacobsen
In addressing a task, one almost always has several possible options, sometimes only a few, and they may all be practical and functional. But they lack the aesthetic aspect that raises it to architecture.::Arne Jacobsen
Architecture tends to consume everything else, it has become one's entire life.::Arne Jacobsen
You will soon find that I am a bit obsessive about my work. And that is a little sad, one often feels strangely restricted, not finding time to simmer, although one actually has many interests.::Arne Jacobsen
And when an architect has designed a house with large windows, which is a necessity today in order to pull the daylight into these very deep houses, then curtains come to play a big role in architecture.::Arne Jacobsen
Proportions are what makes the old Greek temples classic in their beauty. They are like huge blocks, from which the air has been literally hewn out between the columns.::Arne Jacobsen
There can be no knowledge without emotion. We may be aware of a truth, yet until we have felt its force, it is not ours. To the cognition of the brain must be added the experience of the soul.::Arnold Bennett
Any change, even a change for the better, is always accompanied by drawbacks and discomforts.::Arnold Bennett
We shall never have more time. We have, and always had, all the time there is. No object is served in waiting until next week or even until tomorrow. Keep going... Concentrate on something useful.::Arnold Bennett
Mother is far too clever to understand anything she does not like.::Arnold Bennett
Happiness includes chiefly the idea of satisfaction after full honest effort. No one can possibly be satisfied and no one can be happy who feels that in some paramount affairs he failed to take up the challenge of life.::Arnold Bennett
Journalists say a thing that they know isn't true, in the hope that if they keep on saying it long enough it will be true.::Arnold Bennett
To the artist is sometimes granted a sudden, transient insight which serves in this matter for experience. A flash, and where previously the brain held a dead fact, the soul grasps a living truth! At moments we are all artists.::Arnold Bennett
As human beings, we are endowed with freedom of choice, and we cannot shuffle off our responsibility upon the shoulders of God or nature. We must shoulder it ourselves. It is our responsibility.::Arnold J. Toynbee

History is a vision of God's creation on the move.::Arnold J. Toynbee
The equation of religion with belief is rather recent.::Arnold J. Toynbee

Don't go away. I don't want to be alone. I can't stand being alone.::Arnold Rothstein
Jazz is known all over the world as an American musical art form and that's it. No America, no jazz. I've seen people try to connect it to other countries, for instance to Africa, but it doesn't have a damn thing to do with Africa.::Art Blakey
You can't make up anything anymore. The world itself is a satire. All you're doing is recording it.::Art Buchwald
Whether it's the best of times or the worst of times, it's the only time we've got.::Art Buchwald
This is a wonderful way to celebrate an 80th birthday... I wanted to be 65 again, but they wouldn't let me - Homeland Security.::Art Buchwald
In the Top 40, half the songs are secret messages to the teen world to drop out, turn on, and groove with the chemicals and light shows at discotheques.::Art Linkletter
I've learned it's always better to have a small percentage of a big success, than a hundred percent of nothing.::Art Linkletter
I stand fearlessly for small dogs, the American Flag, motherhood and the Bible. That's why people love me.::Art Linkletter
My philosophy is to do the best you can for somebody. Help. It's not just what do you for yourself. It's how you treat people decently. The golden rule. There isn't big anything better than the golden rule. It's in every major religion in one language or another.::Art Linkletter
He has only half learned the art of reading who has not added to it the more refined art of skipping and skimming.::Arthur Balfour
It is unfortunate, considering that enthusiasm moves the world, that so few enthusiasts can be trusted to speak the truth.::Arthur Balfour
Enthusiasm moves the world.::Arthur Balfour

Our lifetime may be the last that will be lived out in a technological society.::Arthur C. Clarke

I consider that a man's brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose.::Arthur Conan Doyle
His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge.::Arthur Conan Doyle
My mind rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work, give me the most abstruse cryptogram, or the most intricate analysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere. But I abhor the dull routine of existence. I crave for mental exaltation.::Arthur Conan Doyle
Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones.::Arthur Conan Doyle
It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.::Arthur Conan Doyle
Our ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret Nature.::Arthur Conan Doyle

There is a single thread of attitude, a single direction of flow, that joins our present time to its early burgeoning in Mediterranean civilization.::Arthur Erickson
I plead for conservation of human culture, which is much more fragile than nature herself. We needn't destroy other cultures with the force of our own.::Arthur Erickson
Space has always been the spiritual dimension of architecture. It is not the physical statement of the structure so much as what it contains that moves us.::Arthur Erickson
Rationalism is the enemy of art, though necessary as a basis for architecture.::Arthur Erickson
Only when inspired to go beyond consciousness by some extraordinary insight does beauty manifest unexpectedly.::Arthur Erickson
Part of our western outlook stems from the scientific attitude and its method of isolating the parts of a phenomenon in order to analyze them.::Arthur Erickson
Architecture doesn't come from theory. You don't think your way through a building.::Arthur Erickson
Great buildings that move the spirit have always been rare. In every case they are unique, poetic, products of the heart.::Arthur Erickson
What is the thread of western civilization that distinguished its course in history? It has to do with the preoccupation of western man with his outward command and his sense of superiority.::Arthur Erickson
This great, though disastrous, culture can only change as we begin to stand off and see... the inveterate materialism which has become the model for cultures around the world.::Arthur Erickson
We are stymied by regulations, limited choice and the threat of litigation. Neither consultants nor industry itself provide research which takes architecture forward.::Arthur Erickson
With production alone as the goal, industry in North America was dominated by the assembly line, standardization for mass consumption.::Arthur Erickson
I'm proud to pay taxes in the United States the only thing is, I could be just as proud for half the money.::Arthur Godfrey

Married and divorced, three beautiful daughters, two in college. The other one is 16, lives with her mom. I'm 46, I've worked for the Post Office for 18 years, seven facilities in three states.::Arthur Godfrey

The more the history of the World War and what led up to it is studied, the more clearly those tragic years become revealed as a vast collapse of civilization.::Arthur Henderson
On the contrary, the characteristic element of the present situation is that economic questions have finally and irrevocably invaded the domain of public life and politics.::Arthur Henderson
It is because I believe that it is in the power of such nations to lead the world back into the paths of peace that I propose to devote myself to explaining what, in my opinion, can and should be done to banish the fear of war that hangs so heavily over the world.::Arthur Henderson
We had four years of world war which the peoples endured only because they were told that their sufferings would free humanity forever from the scourge of war.::Arthur Henderson
To solve the problem of organizing world peace we must establish world law and order.::Arthur Henderson
Another essential to a universal and durable peace is social justice.::Arthur Henderson
He would see civilization in danger of perishing under the oppression of a gigantic paradox: he would see multitudes of people starving in the midst of plenty, and nations preparing for war although pledged to peace.::Arthur Henderson
In our modern world of interdependent nations, hardly any state can wage war successfully without raising loans and buying war materials of every kind in the markets of other nations.::Arthur Henderson
The forces that are driving mankind toward unity and peace are deep-seated and powerful. They are material and natural, as well as moral and intellectual.::Arthur Henderson
In almost every country there are elements of opinion which would welcome such a conclusion because they wish to return to the politics of the balance of power, unrestricted and unregulated armaments, international anarchy, and preparation for war.::Arthur Henderson
The question is, what are we to do in order to consolidate peace on a universal and durable foundation, and what are the essential elements of such a peace?::Arthur Henderson
Moreover, war has become a thing potentially so terrible and destructive that it should have been the common aim of statesmen to put an end to it forever.::Arthur Henderson
Those nations have a very great responsibility at this juncture of the world's affairs, for by throwing their joint weight into the scales of history on the right side, they may tip the balance decisively in favour of peace.::Arthur Henderson
It has become impossible to give up the enterprise of disarmament without abandoning the whole great adventure of building up a collective peace system.::Arthur Henderson
The years of the economic depression have been years of political reaction, and that is why the economic crisis has generated a world peace crisis.::Arthur Henderson
The vast upheaval of the World War set in motion forces that will either destroy civilization or raise mankind to undreamed of heights of human welfare and prosperity.::Arthur Henderson
Thus, the struggle for peace includes the struggle for freedom and justice for the masses of all countries.::Arthur Henderson
The first condition of success for the League of Nations is, therefore, a firm understanding between the British Empire and the United States of America and France and Italy that there will be no competitive building up of fleets or armies between them.::Arthur Henderson
The Disarmament Conference has become the focal point of a great struggle between anarchy and world order... between those who think in terms of inevitable armed conflict and those who seek to build a universal and durable peace.::Arthur Henderson
Four years of world war, at a cost in human suffering which our minds are mercifully too limited to imagine, led to the very clear realization that international anarchy must be abandoned if civilization was to survive.::Arthur Henderson
As a first step there must be an offer to achieve equality of rights in disarmament by abolishing the weapons forbidden to the Central Powers by the Peace Treaties.::Arthur Henderson
In some states militant nationalism has gone to the lengths of dictatorship, the cult of the absolute or totalitarian state and the glorification of war.::Arthur Henderson
In short, it may be said that on paper the obligations to settle international disputes peacefully are now so comprehensive and far-reaching that it is almost impossible for a state to resort to war without violating one or more solemn treaty obligations.::Arthur Henderson
So I decided to move that scene in the doctor's office to two-thirds into the movie, after the viewers had come to know Ryan and Ali and share in their happiness.::Arthur Hiller
We'd be working in our motel room through the night, and I'd come up with an idea at two in the morning, and he'd start jumping up and down, pacing across the room, or whatever.::Arthur Hiller
The highest political buzz word is not liberty, equality, fraternity or solidarity it is service.::Arthur Hugh Clough
In a tribal organization, even in time of peace, service to tribe or state predominates over all self seeking in war, service for the tribe or state becomes supreme, and personal liberty is suspended.::Arthur Keith
Man is by nature competitive, combative, ambitious, jealous, envious, and vengeful.::Arthur Keith
Under no stretch of imagination can war be regarded as an ethical process yet war, force, terror, and propaganda were the evolutionary means employed to weld the German people into a tribal whole.::Arthur Keith
My personal conviction is that science is concerned wholly with truth, not with ethics.::Arthur Keith
Nothing is more sad than the death of an illusion.::Arthur Koestler
Creative activity could be described as a type of learning process where teacher and pupil are located in the same individual.::Arthur Koestler
The prerequisite of originality is the art of forgetting, at the proper moment, what we know.::Arthur Koestler
Courage is never to let your actions be influenced by your fears.::Arthur Koestler
Our markets have not achieved their great successes as a result of government fiat, but rather through efforts of competing interests working to meet the demands of investors and to fulfill the promises posed by advancing technology.::Arthur Levitt
Today, the forces of competition, technology, and globalization have converged to spur innovation and to transform the way business is done in the securities industry.::Arthur Levitt
It is all nonsense, to be sure and so much the greater nonsense inasmuch as the true interpretation of many dreams - not by any means of all dreams - moves, it may be said, in the opposite direction to the method of psycho-analysis.::Arthur Machen
Every branch of human knowledge, if traced up to its source and final principles, vanishes into mystery.::Arthur Machen
Now, everybody, I suppose, is aware that in recent years the silly business of divination by dreams has ceased to be a joke and has become a very serious science.::Arthur Machen
If a man dreams that he has committed a sin before which the sun hid his face, it is often safe to conjecture that, in sheer forgetfulness, he wore a red tie, or brown boots with evening dress.::Arthur Machen
Betrayal is the only truth that sticks.::Arthur Miller
Everybody likes a kidder, but nobody lends him money.::Arthur Miller
The apple cannot be stuck back on the Tree of Knowledge once we begin to see, we are doomed and challenged to seek the strength to see more, not less.::Arthur Miller
The structure of a play is always the story of how the birds came home to roost.::Arthur Miller
It is my art. I am better at it than I ever was. And I will do it as long as I can. When you reach a certain age you can slough off what is unnecessary and concentrate on what is. And why not?::Arthur Miller
I think it's a mistake to ever look for hope outside of one's self.::Arthur Miller
Maybe all one can do is hope to end up with the right regrets.::Arthur Miller
Without alienation, there can be no politics.::Arthur Miller
The problem was to sustain at any cost the feeling you had in the theater that you were watching a real person, yes, but an intense condensation of his experience, not simply a realistic series of episodes.::Arthur Miller
We are the music makers. We are the dreamers of the dream.::Arthur O'Shaughnessy
God is creating at every moment of the world's existence in and through the perpetually endowed creativity of the very stuff of the world.::Arthur Peacocke
I saw that all beings are fated to happiness: action is not life, but a way of wasting some force, an enervation. Morality is the weakness of the brain.::Arthur Rimbaud
Only divine love bestows the keys of knowledge.::Arthur Rimbaud
You know, a lot of people are just interested in, in building a company so they can make money and get out.::Arthur Rock

The labour movement had the best opportunity in 50 years to transform not merely an industrial situation and win an important battle for workers in struggle, but an opportunity to change the government of the day.::Arthur Scargill
All too often miners, and indeed other trade unionists, underestimate the economic strength they have.::Arthur Scargill
Yet what you need is not marches, demonstrations, rallies or wide associations, all of them are important. What you need is direct action. The sooner people understand that, the sooner we'll begin to change things.::Arthur Scargill
The trouble with the Labour Party leadership and the trade union leadership, they're quite willing to applaud millions on the streets of the Philippines or in Eastern Europe, without understanding the need to also produce millions of people on the streets of Britain.::Arthur Scargill

The greatest of follies is to sacrifice health for any other kind of happiness.::Arthur Schopenhauer

Great men are like eagles, and build their nest on some lofty solitude.::Arthur Schopenhauer

Politeness is to human nature what warmth is to wax.::Arthur Schopenhauer
It is only a man's own fundamental thoughts that have truth and life in them. For it is these that he really and completely understands. To read the thoughts of others is like taking the remains of someone else's meal, like putting on the discarded clothes of a stranger.::Arthur Schopenhauer
It is with trifles, and when he is off guard, that a man best reveals his character.::Arthur Schopenhauer
A financier is a pawnbroker with imagination.::Arthur Wing Pinero
We may take it to be the accepted idea that the Mosaic books were not handed down to us for our instruction in scientific knowledge, and that it is our duty to ground our scientific beliefs upon observation and inference, unmixed with considerations of a different order.::Asa Gray
It remains to consider what attitude thoughtful men and Christian believers should take respecting them, and how they stand related to beliefs of another order.::Asa Gray
The moments of happiness we enjoy take us by surprise. It is not that we seize them, but that they seize us.::Ashley Montagu
One goes through school, college, medical school and one's internship learning little or nothing about goodness but a good deal about success.::Ashley Montagu
The natural superiority of women is a biological fact, and a socially acknowledged reality.::Ashley Montagu
It is work, work that one delights in, that is the surest guarantor of happiness. But even here it is a work that has to be earned by labor in one's earlier years. One should labor so hard in youth that everything one does subsequently is easy by comparison.::Ashley Montagu
Science has proof without any certainty. Creationists have certainty without any proof.::Ashley Montagu
The doctor has been taught to be interested not in health but in disease. What the public is taught is that health is the cure for disease.::Ashley Montagu
There have been some medical schools in which somewhere along the assembly line, a faculty member has informed the students, not so much by what he said but by what he did, that there is an intimate relation between curing and caring.::Ashley Montagu
The idea is to die young as late as possible.::Ashley Montagu
The principal contributor to loneliness in this country is television. What happens is that the family 'gets together' alone.::Ashley Montagu

I can't really define it in sexual terms alone although our sexuality is so energizing why not enjoy it too?::Audre Lorde
When we create out of our experiences, as feminists of color, women of color, we have to develop those structures that will present and circulate our culture.::Audre Lorde
I write for those women who do not speak, for those who do not have a voice because they were so terrified, because we are taught to respect fear more than ourselves. We've been taught that silence would save us, but it won't.::Audre Lorde
I am deliberate and afraid of nothing.::Audre Lorde
When I dare to be powerful - to use my strength in the service of my vision, then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid.::Audre Lorde
But the true feminist deals out of a lesbian consciousness whether or not she ever sleeps with women.::Audre Lorde
There's always someone asking you to underline one piece of yourself - whether it's Black, woman, mother, dyke, teacher, etc. - because that's the piece that they need to key in to. They want to dismiss everything else.::Audre Lorde
Black women are programmed to define ourselves within this male attention and to compete with each other for it rather than to recognize and move upon our common interests.::Audre Lorde
I remember how being young and black and gay and lonely felt. A lot of it was fine, feeling I had the truth and the light and the key, but a lot of it was purely hell.::Audre Lorde
I would like to do another piece of fiction dealing with a number of issues: Lesbian parenting, the 1960's, and interracial relationships in the Lesbian and Gay community.::Audre Lorde
Black women sharing close ties with each other, politically or emotionally, are not the enemies of Black men.::Audre Lorde
We have to consciously study how to be tender with each other until it becomes a habit because what was native has been stolen from us, the love of Black women for each other.::Audre Lorde
When I use my strength in the service of my vision it makes no difference whether or not I am afraid.::Audre Lorde
But, on the other hand, I get bored with racism too and recognize that there are still many things to be said about a Black person and a White person loving each other in a racist society.::Audre Lorde
The quality of light by which we scrutinize our lives has direct bearing upon the product which we live, and upon the changes which we hope to bring about through those lives.::Audre Lorde
The failure of academic feminists to recognize difference as a crucial strength is a failure to reach beyond the first patriarchal lesson. In our world, divide and conquer must become define and empower.::Audre Lorde
Art is not living. It is the use of living.::Audre Lorde
In our work and in our living, we must recognize that difference is a reason for celebration and growth, rather than a reason for destruction.::Audre Lorde
The learning process is something you can incite, literally incite, like a riot.::Audre Lorde
Poetry is not only dream and vision it is the skeleton architecture of our lives. It lays the foundations for a future of change, a bridge across our fears of what has never been before.::Audre Lorde
It's a struggle but that's why we exist, so that another generation of Lesbians of color will not have to invent themselves, or their history, all over again.::Audre Lorde
In discussions around the hiring and firing of Black faculty at universities, the charge is frequently heard that Black women are more easily hired than are Black men.::Audre Lorde

If I'm honest I have to tell you I still read fairy-tales and I like them best of all.::Audrey Hepburn
The most important thing is to enjoy your life - to be happy - it's all that matters.::Audrey Hepburn
Nothing is impossible, the word itself says 'I'm possible'!::Audrey Hepburn
Pick the day. Enjoy it - to the hilt. The day as it comes. People as they come... The past, I think, has helped me appreciate the present - and I don't want to spoil any of it by fretting about the future.::Audrey Hepburn
I don't want to be alone, I want to be left alone.::Audrey Hepburn
Success is like reaching an important birthday and finding you're exactly the same.::Audrey Hepburn
I probably hold the distinction of being one movie star who, by all laws of logic, should never have made it. At each stage of my career, I lacked the experience.::Audrey Hepburn
Paris is always a good idea.::Audrey Hepburn
I believe in pink. I believe that laughing is the best calorie burner. I believe in kissing, kissing a lot. I believe in being strong when everything seems to be going wrong. I believe that happy girls are the prettiest girls. I believe that tomorrow is another day and I believe in miracles.::Audrey Hepburn
If I get married, I want to be very married.::Audrey Hepburn
Everything I learned I learned from the movies.::Audrey Hepburn
The best thing to hold onto in life is each other.::Audrey Hepburn
The beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears, the figure that she carries or the way she combs her hair.::Audrey Hepburn
For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone.::Audrey Hepburn
The beauty of a woman is not in a facial mode but the true beauty in a woman is reflected in her soul. It is the caring that she lovingly gives the passion that she shows. The beauty of a woman grows with the passing years.::Audrey Hepburn
I'm an introvert... I love being by myself, love being outdoors, love taking a long walk with my dogs and looking at the trees, flowers, the sky.::Audrey Hepburn
If my world were to cave in tomorrow, I would look back on all the pleasures, excitements and worthwhilenesses I have been lucky enough to have had. Not the sadness, not my miscarriages or my father leaving home, but the joy of everything else. It will have been enough.::Audrey Hepburn
I have to be alone very often. I'd be quite happy if I spent from Saturday night until Monday morning alone in my apartment. That's how I refuel.::Audrey Hepburn
I love people who make me laugh. I honestly think it's the thing I like most, to laugh. It cures a multitude of ills. It's probably the most important thing in a person.::Audrey Hepburn
I was born with an enormous need for affection, and a terrible need to give it.::Audrey Hepburn
I heard a definition once: Happiness is health and a short memory! I wish I'd invented it, because it is very true.::Audrey Hepburn
I was asked to act when I couldn't act. I was asked to sing 'Funny Face' when I couldn't sing, and dance with Fred Astaire when I couldn't dance - and do all kinds of things I wasn't prepared for. Then I tried like mad to cope with it.::Audrey Hepburn
When you have nobody you can make a cup of tea for, when nobody needs you, that's when I think life is over.::Audrey Hepburn
The beauty of a woman must be seen from in her eyes, because that is the doorway to her heart, the place where love resides.::Audrey Hepburn
I decided, very early on, just to accept life unconditionally I never expected it to do anything special for me, yet I seemed to accomplish far more than I had ever hoped. Most of the time it just happened to me without my ever seeking it.::Audrey Hepburn
They weren't impatient for the boys to turn into cartoons again. They awarded sympathy, gave compassion. Because deep down they had found parts of themselves in the characters. You said it George.::Audrey Meadows
I always disliked dogs, those protectors of cowards who lack the courage to fight an assailant themselves.::August Strindberg
People who keep dogs are cowards who haven't got the guts to bite people themselves.::August Strindberg
Happiness consumes itself like a flame. It cannot burn for ever, it must go out, and the presentiment of its end destroys it at its very peak.::August Strindberg
Friendship can only exist between persons with similar interests and points of view. Man and woman by the conventions of society are born with different interests and different points of view.::August Strindberg
That is the thankless position of the father in the family - the provider for all, and the enemy of all.::August Strindberg
Each department of knowledge passes through three stages. The theoretic stage the theological stage and the metaphysical or abstract stage.::Auguste Comte

I choose a block of marble and chop off whatever I don't need.::Auguste Rodin

To any artist, worthy of the name, all in nature is beautiful, because his eyes, fearlessly accepting all exterior truth, read there, as in an open book, all the inner truth.::Auguste Rodin

The intellect of the wise is like glass it admits the light of heaven and reflects it.::Augustus Hare

The power of faith will often shine forth the most when the character is naturally weak.::Augustus Hare
Thought is the wind, knowledge the sail, and mankind the vessel.::Augustus Hare

The knowledge of anything, since all things have causes, is not acquired or complete unless it is known by its causes.::Avicenna

The ladder of success is best climbed by stepping on the rungs of opportunity.::Ayn Rand
We are fast approaching the stage of the ultimate inversion: the stage where the government is free to do anything it pleases, while the citizens may act only by permission which is the stage of the darkest periods of human history, the stage of rule by brute force.::Ayn Rand
Upper classes are a nation's past the middle class is its future.::Ayn Rand
Throughout the centuries there were men who took first steps, down new roads, armed with nothing but their own vision.::Ayn Rand
Potentially, a government is the most dangerous threat to man's rights: it holds a legal monopoly on the use of physical force against legally disarmed victims.::Ayn Rand

Money is only a tool. It will take you wherever you wish, but it will not replace you as the driver.::Ayn Rand
Money is the barometer of a society's virtue.::Ayn Rand
The only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals. Well, when there aren't enough criminals, one makes them. One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws.::Ayn Rand
Do not ever say that the desire to 'do good' by force is a good motive. Neither power-lust nor stupidity are good motives.::Ayn Rand
God... a being whose only definition is that he is beyond man's power to conceive.::Ayn Rand

Achieving life is not the equivalent of avoiding death.::Ayn Rand

Life should be great rather than long.::B. R. Ambedkar
I measure the progress of a community by the degree of progress which women have achieved.::B. R. Ambedkar
Unlike a drop of water which loses its identity when it joins the ocean, man does not lose his being in the society in which he lives. Man's life is independent. He is born not for the development of the society alone, but for the development of his self.::B. R. Ambedkar
History shows that where ethics and economics come in conflict, victory is always with economics. Vested interests have never been known to have willingly divested themselves unless there was sufficient force to compel them.::B. R. Ambedkar
A people and their religion must be judged by social standards based on social ethics. No other standard would have any meaning if religion is held to be necessary good for the well-being of the people.::B. R. Ambedkar
Political tyranny is nothing compared to the social tyranny and a reformer who defies society is a more courageous man than a politician who defies Government.::B. R. Ambedkar

Baseball was, is and always will be to me the best game in the world.::Babe Ruth

Reading isn't good for a ballplayer. Not good for his eyes. If my eyes went bad even a little bit I couldn't hit home runs. So I gave up reading.::Babe Ruth

Never let the fear of striking out get in your way.::Babe Ruth

I'm not a competitive person, and I think women like me because they don't think I'm competitive, just nice.::Barbara Bush
Cherish your human connections - your relationships with friends and family.::Barbara Bush
It was the dumbest thing I had ever seen, but it's a family thing, and I guess it's clean.::Barbara Bush
The personal things should be left out of platforms at conventions. You can argue yourself blue in the face, and you're not going to change each other's minds. It's a waste of your time and my time.::Barbara Bush
To us, family means putting your arms around each other and being there.::Barbara Bush
Well, look at what people are doing for returned veterans now. The wounded warriors. They're working hard to make the wounded veterans feel that they are loved and welcomed home, unlike Vietnam. It was not a very kind, gentle world then. I think we are kinder and gentler.::Barbara Bush
Family and friends and faith are the most important things in your life and you should be building friendships.::Barbara Bush
At the end of your life, you will never regret not having passed one more test, not winning one more verdict or not closing one more deal. You will regret time not spent with a husband, a friend, a child, or a parent.::Barbara Bush

Never lose sight of the fact that the most important yardstick of your success will be how you treat other people - your family, friends, and coworkers, and even strangers you meet along the way.::Barbara Bush
Raising five boys is a handful, trust me.::Barbara Bush
Value your friendship. Value your relationships.::Barbara Bush
I'm worried about parents who aren't parenting.::Barbara Bush
I married the first man I ever kissed. When I tell this to my children, they just about throw up.::Barbara Bush
I decided I ought to pick a project that would not be controversial, that would not really cost the government a lot of money.::Barbara Bush
Bias has to be taught. If you hear your parents downgrading women or people of different backgrounds, why, you are going to do that.::Barbara Bush
Suddenly women's lib had made me feel my life had been wasted.::Barbara Bush
The right diet directs sexual energy into the parts that matter.::Barbara Cartland
A woman asking 'Am I good? Am I satisfied?' is extremely selfish. The less women fuss about themselves, the less they talk to other women, the more they try to please their husbands, the happier the marriage is going to be.::Barbara Cartland
He described how, as a boy of 14, his dad had been down the mining pit, his uncle had been down the pit, his brother had been down the pit, and of course he would go down the pit.::Barbara Castle

I've always supported myself. I like the sense of knowing exactly where I stand financially, but there is a side of me that longs for a knight in shining armor.::Barbara Feldon
I'm not saying that there's anything better than mated bliss at its best, but I'm saying that living alone is as good in its own way. But we haven't quite given ourselves permission to recognize that.::Barbara Feldon
Our awesome responsibility to ourselves, to our children, and to the future is to create ourselves in the image of goodness, because the future depends on the nobility of our imaginings.::Barbara Grizzuti Harrison
Fantasies are more than substitutes for unpleasant reality they are also dress rehearsals, plans. All acts performed in the world begin in the imagination.::Barbara Grizzuti Harrison
Kindness and intelligence don't always deliver us from the pitfalls and traps: there are always failures of love, of will, of imagination. There is no way to take the danger out of human relationships.::Barbara Grizzuti Harrison
True revolutionaries are like God - they create the world in their own image. Our awesome responsibility to ourselves, to our children, and to the future is to create ourselves in the image of goodness, because the future depends on the nobility of our imaginings.::Barbara Grizzuti Harrison
Throughout out history, when people have looked for new ways to solve their problems, and to uphold the principles of this nation, many times they have turned to political parties. They have often turned to the Democratic Party.::Barbara Jordan
Think what a better world it would be if we all, the whole world, had cookies and milk about three o'clock every afternoon and then lay down on our blankets for a nap.::Barbara Jordan
More is required of public officials than slogans and handshakes and press releases. More is required. We must hold ourselves strictly accountable. We must provide the people with a vision of the future.::Barbara Jordan
We call ourselves public servants but I'll tell you this: we as public servants must set an example for the rest of the nation. It is hypocritical for the public official to admonish and exhort the people to uphold the common good.::Barbara Jordan
For all of its uncertainty, we cannot flee the future.::Barbara Jordan
What the people want is very simple - they want an America as good as its promise.::Barbara Jordan
What we have to do is strike a balance between the idea that government should do everything and the idea, the belief, that government ought to do nothing. Strike a balance.::Barbara Jordan
We are a people in a quandary about the present. We are a people in search of our future. We are a people in search of a national community.::Barbara Jordan
We must not become the new puritans and reject our society. We must address and master the future together. It can be done if we restore the belief that we share a sense of national community, that we share a common national endeavor. It can be done.::Barbara Jordan
We have a positive vision of the future founded on the belief that the gap between the promise and reality of America can one day be finally closed. We believe that.::Barbara Jordan
Education remains the key to both economic and political empowerment.::Barbara Jordan
A government is invigorated when each of us is willing to participate in shaping the future of this nation.::Barbara Jordan
Do not call for black power or green power. Call for brain power.::Barbara Jordan
We are a party of innovation. We do not reject our traditions, but we are willing to adapt to changing circumstances, when change we must. We are willing to suffer the discomfort of change in order to achieve a better future.::Barbara Jordan
We cannot improve on the system of government handed down to us by the founders of the Republic. There is no way to improve upon that. But what we can do is to find new ways to implement that system and realize our destiny.::Barbara Jordan
If you know you are on the right track, if you have this inner knowledge, then nobody can turn you off... no matter what they say.::Barbara McClintock
Community colleges are one of America's great social inventions a gateway to the future for first time students looking for an affordable college education, and for mid-career students looking to get ahead in the workplace.::Barbara Mikulski
Women would be disproportionately affected by the privatization of social security. It is one of the most important safety nets for American women in old age, or in times of disability, to insure financial income for their families.::Barbara Mikulski
A pregnant woman facing the most dire circumstances must be able to count on her doctor to do what is medically necessary to protect her from serious physical harm.::Barbara Mikulski

The cure for sorrow is to learn something.::Barbara Sher
Change is not only likely, it's inevitable.::Barbara Sher
When you start using senses you've neglected, your reward is to see the world with completely fresh eyes.::Barbara Sher
When you play it too safe, you're taking the biggest risk of your life. Time is the only wealth we're given.::Barbara Sher
Doing is a quantum leap from imagining.::Barbara Sher
The amount of good luck coming your way depends on your willingness to act.::Barbara Sher
And our dreams are who we are.::Barbara Sher
Success can make you go one of two ways. It can make you a prima donna - or it can smooth the edges, take away the insecurities, let the nice things come out.::Barbara Walters
I found it interesting that as people become more technically oriented all over the world, at the same time people are becoming increasingly spiritual. The success of the Da Vinci code - even though it was a great yawn - also showed people's interest in religion.::Barbara Walters
First of all, the Jewish religion has a great deal in common with the Christian religion because, as Rabbi Gillman points out in the show, Christianity is based on Judaism. Christ was Jewish.::Barbara Walters
A great many people think that polysyllables are a sign of intelligence.::Barbara Walters
The sports page records people's accomplishments, the front page usually records nothing, but man's failures.::Barbara Walters
Deep breaths are very helpful at shallow parties.::Barbara Walters
I also found that for myself, since I've had no religious education, it was so interesting to see the different versions of heaven and what life on earth means.::Barbara Walters
After the atomic bombs were dropped, the war ended and we went into Tokyo Bay with the rest of the fleet, the Missouri and the rest of them, while they signed the terms of surrender that ended the war.::Barney Ross
All we had aboard the ship that morning was one Annapolis graduate and three reserves.::Barney Ross
It reflects a prevailing myth that production technology is no more amenable to human judgment or social interests than the laws of thermodynamics, atomic structure or biological inheritance.::Barry Commoner
What is needed now is a transformation of the major systems of production more profound than even the sweeping post-World War II changes in production technology.::Barry Commoner
The environmental crisis arises from a fundamental fault: our systems of production - in industry, agriculture, energy and transportation - essential as they are, make people sick and die.::Barry Commoner

Patriots always talk of dying for their country and never of killing for their country.::Bertrand Russell

A sure way to lose happiness, I found, is to want it at the expense of everything else.::Bette Davis
There are new words now that excuse everybody. Give me the good old days of heroes and villains, the people you can bravo or hiss. There was a truth to them that all the slick credulity of today cannot touch.::Bette Davis
An affair now and then is good for a marriage. It adds spice, stops it from getting boring... I ought to know.::Bette Davis
I work to stay alive.::Bette Davis
I've lost my faith in science.::Bette Davis
Brought up to respect the conventions, love had to end in marriage. I'm afraid it did.::Bette Davis
Wave after wave of love flooded the stage and washed over me, the beginning of the one great durable romance of my life.::Bette Davis
To fulfill a dream, to be allowed to sweat over lonely labor, to be given a chance to create, is the meat and potatoes of life. The money is the gravy.::Bette Davis
I'd luv to kiss ya, but I just washed my hair.::Bette Davis
I was never very interested in boys - and there were plenty of them - vying with one another to see how many famous women they would get into the hay.::Bette Davis

I've always liked men better than women.::Bette Davis
Strong women only marry weak men.::Bette Davis
I'd marry again if I found a man who had fifteen million dollars, would sign over half to me, and guarantee that he'd be dead within a year.::Bette Davis
Sex is a part of love. You shouldn't go around doing it unless you are in love.::Bettie Page
If you go out to dinner with someone, you find out what they prefer in food. We ought to be able to have a conversation to find out what people prefer when it comes to sex.::Betty Dodson
We are constantly protecting the male ego, and it's a disservice to men. If a man has any sensitivity or intelligence, he wants to get the straight scoop from his girlfriend.::Betty Dodson
The search for human freedom can never be complete without freedom for women.::Betty Ford
Aging is not lost youth but a new stage of opportunity and strength.::Betty Friedan
Anger tears me up inside... My own... or anyone else's.::Betty White
I kid around a lot, but pranks are not my best strength!::Betty White
During the Depression, my dad made radios to sell to make extra money. Nobody had any money to buy the radios, so he would trade them for dogs. He built kennels in the backyard, and he cared for the dogs.::Betty White
I enjoy being busy, I really do. Remember, I'm the stub end of the railroad. I have no family, so I'm not taking busy time away from people that I should be spending it with. So I'm just relaxing and enjoying it.::Betty White
I just make it my business to get along with people so I can have fun. It's that simple.::Betty White
I like bawdy humor. I love bawdy humor, but not dirty humor.::Betty White
I stayed in show business to pay for my animal business.::Betty White
I always wanted to be a zookeeper when I was growing up, and I've wound up a zookeeper! I've been working with the Los Angeles Zoo for 45 years! I'm the luckiest old broad on two feet because my life is divided absolutely in half - half animals and half show business. You can't ask for better than two things you love the most.::Betty White
I'm a big cockeyed optimist. I try to accentuate the positive as opposed to the negative.::Betty White
Well, I mean, if a joke or humor is bawdy, it's got to be funny enough to warrant it. You can't just have it bawdy or dirty just for the sake of being that - it's got to be funny.::Betty White
I think older women still have a full life.::Betty White
It's your outlook on life that counts. If you take yourself lightly and don't take yourself too seriously, pretty soon you can find the humor in our everyday lives. And sometimes it can be a lifesaver.::Betty White
I think it's your mental attitude. So many of us start dreading age in high school and that's a waste of a lovely life. 'Oh... I'm 30, oh, I'm 40, oh, 50.' Make the most of it.::Betty White
Wendy Malick and Valerie Bertinelli make fun of me, but I take care of my health - I don't abuse it.::Betty White
My mother and dad were big animal lovers, too. I just don't know how I would have lived without animals around me. I'm fascinated by them - both domestic pets and the wild community. They just are the most interesting things in the world to me, and it's made such a difference in my lifetime.::Betty White
I'm in the acting business. That's the ego business.::Betty White
I'm not what you might call sexy, but I'm romantic. Let's put it that way.::Betty White
If you get into a Broadway show and it doesn't work, you're a failure. And if it does work, you may be stuck for who knows how long. It just doesn't sound great to me!::Betty White
I am interested in a lot of things - not just show business and my passion for animals. I try to keep current in what's going on in the world. I do mental exercises. I don't have any trouble memorizing lines because of the crossword puzzles I do every day to keep my mind a little limber. I don't sit and vegetate.::Betty White
The bottom line is, I'm blessed with good health. On top of that, I don't go around thinking 'Oh, I'm 90, I better do this or I better do that.' I'm just Betty. I'm the same Betty that I've always been. Take it or leave it.::Betty White
It's a little known fact that one in three family pets gets lost during its lifetime, and approximately 9 million pets enter shelters each year. That's why it's a wonderful thing to get your pet microchipped and registered with your contact information because then they can be located and the owners can track where their pets are.::Betty White
I cannot stand the people who get wonderful starts in show business and who abuse it. Lindsay Lohan and Charlie Sheen, for example, although there are plenty of others, too. They are the most blessed people in the world, and they don't appreciate it.::Betty White
I'm not into animal rights. I'm only into animal welfare and health. I've been with the Morris Animal Foundation since the '70s. We're a health organization. We fund campaign health studies for dogs, cats, lizards and wildlife. I've worked with the L.A. Zoo for about the same length of time. I get my animal fixes!::Betty White
Marriage - a book of which the first chapter is written in poetry and the remaining chapters in prose.::Beverley Nichols
I don't think children's inner feelings have changed. They still want a mother and father in the very same house they want places to play.::Beverly Cleary
When I was in the first grade I was afraid of the teacher and had a miserable time in the reading circle, a difficulty that was overcome by the loving patience of my second grade teacher. Even though I could read, I refused to do so.::Beverly Cleary
I write in longhand on yellow legal pads.::Beverly Cleary
I don't necessarily start with the beginning of the book. I just start with the part of the story that's most vivid in my imagination and work forward and backward from there.::Beverly Cleary
In youth we run into difficulties. In old age difficulties run into us.::Beverly Sills
My dear brothers, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry, for man's anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires.::Beverly Sills
Anger begins with folly, and ends with repentance.::Beverly Sills
There is a growing strength in women but it's in the forehead, not the forearm.::Beverly Sills
Art is the signature of civilizations.::Beverly Sills
A primary function of art and thought is to liberate the individual from the tyranny of his culture in the environmental sense and to permit him to stand beyond it in an autonomy of perception and judgment.::Beverly Sills
A good person can make another person good it means that goodness will elicit goodness in the society other persons will also be good.::Bhumibol Adulyadej

In Thailand's history there have been dissensions from time to time, but in general, unity has prevailed.::Bhumibol Adulyadej
We are, in the comics, the last frontier of good, wholesome family humor and entertainment.::Bil Keane
I don't just try to be funny.::Bil Keane
A hug is like a boomerang - you get it back right away.::Bil Keane
Yesterday's the past, tomorrow's the future, but today is a gift. That's why it's called the present.::Bil Keane
On radio and television, magazines and the movies, you can't tell what you're going to get. When you look at the comic page, you can usually depend on something acceptable by the entire family.::Bil Keane
Red is the ultimate cure for sadness.::Bill Blass
Something about glamour interested me. All my schoolbooks had drawings of women on terraces with a cocktail and a cigarette.::Bill Blass
A teacher is never too smart to learn from his pupils. But while runners differ, basic principles never change. So it's a matter of fitting your current practices to fit the event and the individual. See, what's good for you might not be worth a darn for the next guy.::Bill Bowerman
Sometimes they are a matter of luck the photographer could not expect or hope for them. Sometimes they are a matter of patience, waiting for an effect to be repeated that he has seen and lost or for one that he anticipates.::Bill Brandt
Men and women belong to different species and communications between them is still in its infancy.::Bill Cosby
Human beings are the only creatures on earth that allow their children to come back home.::Bill Cosby
Civilization had too many rules for me, so I did my best to rewrite them.::Bill Cosby
Let us now set forth one of the fundamental truths about marriage: the wife is in charge.::Bill Cosby
If you have no faith, you've lost your battle.::Bill Cosby
Fatherhood is pretending the present you love most is soap-on-a-rope.::Bill Cosby
Sex education may be a good idea in the schools, but I don't believe the kids should be given homework.::Bill Cosby
The main goal of the future is to stop violence. The world is addicted to it.::Bill Cosby
The first-born in every family is always dreaming for an imaginary older brother or sister who will look out for them.::Bill Cosby
Through humor, you can soften some of the worst blows that life delivers. And once you find laughter, no matter how painful your situation might be, you can survive it.::Bill Cosby
Having a child is surely the most beautifully irrational act that two people in love can commit.::Bill Cosby
Like everyone else who makes the mistake of getting older, I begin each day with coffee and obituaries.::Bill Cosby
A word to the wise ain't necessary - it's the stupid ones that need the advice.::Bill Cosby
I cannot understand how the education of this United States of America has been fooled time and time again. Either make it separate but equal or integrate, therefore it will be equal. And it has been separate and unequal.::Bill Cosby
I guess the real reason that my wife and I had children is the same reason that Napoleon had for invading Russia: it seemed like a good idea at the time.::Bill Cosby
You can turn painful situations around through laughter. If you can find humor in anything, even poverty, you can survive it.::Bill Cosby
I am certainly not an authority on love because there are no authorities on love, just those who've had luck with it and those who haven't.::Bill Cosby
There is hope for the future because God has a sense of humor and we are funny to God.::Bill Cosby
Family is conflict and it's something that we all relate to.::Bill Cosby
I often try to tell kids to think about all the people who love you, don't cry over the one person who doesn't.::Bill Cosby
Raising children is an incredibly hard and risky business in which no cumulative wisdom is gained: each generation repeats the mistakes the previous one made.::Bill Cosby
We're not raising children with the love that we need to.::Bill Cosby
The truth is that parents are not really interested in justice. They just want quiet.::Bill Cosby
Any man today who returns from work, sinks into a chair, and calls for his pipe is a man with an appetite for danger.::Bill Cosby
Poets have said that the reason to have children is to give yourself immortality. Immortality? Now that I have five children, my only hope is that they are all out of the house before I die.::Bill Cosby
Women don't want to hear what you think. Women want to hear what they think - in a deeper voice.::Bill Cosby
No matter how calmly you try to referee, parenting will eventually produce bizarre behavior, and I'm not talking about the kids. Their behavior is always normal.::Bill Cosby
Nothing separates the generations more than music. By the time a child is eight or nine, he has developed a passion for his own music that is even stronger than his passions for procrastination and weird clothes.::Bill Cosby
The heart of marriage is memories and if the two of you happen to have the same ones and can savor your reruns, then your marriage is a gift from the gods.::Bill Cosby
A new father quickly learns that his child invariably comes to the bathroom at precisely the times when he's in there, as if he needed company. The only way for this father to be certain of bathroom privacy is to shave at the gas station.::Bill Cosby
Gray hair is God's graffiti.::Bill Cosby
My childhood should have taught me lessons for my own fatherhood, but it didn't because parenting can only be learned by people who have no children.::Bill Cosby
I don't know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please everybody.::Bill Cosby
In order to succeed, your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure.::Bill Cosby
Every success story has a parent who says, 'over my dead body.' Every success story has an old person who walks up to you and says, when you're acting the fool, 'you know I worry about you sometimes.'::Bill Cosby
I think the part of media that romanticizes criminal behavior, things that a person will say against women, profanity, being gangster, having multiple children with multiple men and women and not wanting to is prevalent. When you look at the majority of shows on television they placate that kind of behavior.::Bill Cosby

As a student I learned from wonderful teachers and ever since then I've thought everyone is a teacher.::Bill Moyers
The printed page conveys information and commitment, and requires active involvement. Television conveys emotion and experience, and it's very limited in what it can do logically. It's an existential experience - there and then gone.::Bill Moyers
War, except in self-defense, is a failure of moral imagination.::Bill Moyers
Secrecy is the freedom tyrants dream of.::Bill Moyers

It is not the body's posture, but the heart's attitude that counts when we pray.::Billy Graham

A revival does two things. First, it returns the Church from her backsliding and second, it causes the conversion of men and women and it always includes the conviction of sin on the part of the Church. What a spell the devil seems to cast over the Church today!::Billy Sunday
If you don't do your part, don't blame God.::Billy Sunday

And if the great fear had not come upon me, as it did, and forced me to do my duty, I might have been less good to the people than some man who had never dreamed at all, even with the memory of so great a vision in me.::Black Elk
I cured with the power that came through me.::Black Elk
Grown men can learn from very little children for the hearts of little children are pure. Therefore, the Great Spirit may show to them many things which older people miss.::Black Elk
Also, as I lay there thinking of my vision, I could see it all again and feel the meaning with a part of me like a strange power glowing in my body but when the part of me that talks would try to make words for the meaning, it would be like fog and get away from me.::Black Elk
Sometimes dreams are wiser than waking.::Black Elk
I know now what this meant, that the bison were the gift of a good spirit and were our strength, but we should lose them, and from the same good spirit we must find another strength.::Black Elk
I think I have told you, but if I have not, you must have understood, that a man who has a vision is not able to use the power of it until after he has performed the vision on earth for the people to see.::Black Elk
You see, I had been riding with the storm clouds, and had come to earth as rain, and it was drought that I had killed with the power that the Six Grandfathers gave me.::Black Elk
Now suddenly there was nothing but a world of cloud, and we three were there alone in the middle of a great white plain with snowy hills and mountains staring at us and it was very still but there were whispers.::Black Elk
To use the power of the bison, I had to perform that part of my vision for the people to see.::Black Elk
I had a vision with which I might have saved my people, but I had not the strength to do it.::Black Elk
There can never be peace between nations until there is first known that true peace which is within the souls of men.::Black Elk
The boys of my people began very young to learn the ways of men, and no one taught us we just learned by doing what we saw, and we were warriors at a time when boys now are like girls.::Black Elk
We want to take good tidings home to our people, that they may sleep in peace.::Black Kettle
Although the troops have struck us, we throw it all behind and are glad to meet you in peace and friendship.::Black Kettle
We have been travelling through a cloud. The sky has been dark ever since the war began.::Black Kettle
The immortality of the soul is a matter which is of so great consequence to us and which touches us so profoundly that we must have lost all feeling to be indifferent about it.::Blaise Pascal
Men are so necessarily mad, that not to be mad would amount to another form of madness.::Blaise Pascal
Chance gives rise to thoughts, and chance removes them no art can keep or acquire them.::Blaise Pascal
Atheism shows strength of mind, but only to a certain degree.::Blaise Pascal
To have no time for philosophy is to be a true philosopher.::Blaise Pascal
Men blaspheme what they do not know.::Blaise Pascal
Imagination disposes of everything it creates beauty, justice, and happiness, which are everything in this world.::Blaise Pascal
Imagination decides everything.::Blaise Pascal
The greater intellect one has, the more originality one finds in men. Ordinary persons find no difference between men.::Blaise Pascal
If all men knew what others say of them, there would not be four friends in the world.::Blaise Pascal
Can anything be stupider than that a man has the right to kill me because he lives on the other side of a river and his ruler has a quarrel with mine, though I have not quarrelled with him?::Blaise Pascal
The greatness of man is great in that he knows himself to be wretched. A tree does not know itself to be wretched.::Blaise Pascal
Small minds are concerned with the extraordinary, great minds with the ordinary.::Blaise Pascal
Men often take their imagination for their heart and they believe they are converted as soon as they think of being converted.::Blaise Pascal
Nothing gives rest but the sincere search for truth.::Blaise Pascal
Human beings must be known to be loved but Divine beings must be loved to be known.::Blaise Pascal
Noble deeds that are concealed are most esteemed.::Blaise Pascal
The heart has its reasons of which reason knows nothing.::Blaise Pascal
Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from religious conviction.::Blaise Pascal
Contradiction is not a sign of falsity, nor the lack of contradiction a sign of truth.::Blaise Pascal
The struggle alone pleases us, not the victory.::Blaise Pascal
Our nature consists in motion complete rest is death.::Blaise Pascal
Men despise religion. They hate it and are afraid it may be true.::Blaise Pascal
There is a God shaped vacuum in the heart of every man which cannot be filled by any created thing, but only by God, the Creator, made known through Jesus.::Blaise Pascal
Our soul is cast into a body, where it finds number, time, dimension. Thereupon it reasons, and calls this nature necessity, and can believe nothing else.::Blaise Pascal
It is the heart which perceives God and not the reason. That is what faith is: God perceived by the heart, not by the reason.::Blaise Pascal
Time heals griefs and quarrels, for we change and are no longer the same persons. Neither the offender nor the offended are any more themselves.::Blaise Pascal
As men are not able to fight against death, misery, ignorance, they have taken it into their heads, in order to be happy, not to think of them at all.::Blaise Pascal
Two things control men's nature, instinct and experience.::Blaise Pascal
Vanity of science. Knowledge of physical science will not console me for ignorance of morality in time of affliction, but knowledge of morality will always console me for ignorance of physical science.::Blaise Pascal
Man's true nature being lost, everything becomes his nature as, his true good being lost, everything becomes his good.::Blaise Pascal
Faith indeed tells what the senses do not tell, but not the contrary of what they see. It is above them and not contrary to them.::Blaise Pascal
Man's greatness lies in his power of thought.::Blaise Pascal
Faith embraces many truths which seem to contradict each other.::Blaise Pascal
There are only two kinds of men: the righteous who think they are sinners and the sinners who think they are righteous.::Blaise Pascal
One must know oneself. If this does not serve to discover truth, it at least serves as a rule of life and there is nothing better.::Blaise Pascal
Faith certainly tells us what the senses do not, but not the contrary of what they see it is above, not against them.::Blaise Pascal
It is incomprehensible that God should exist, and it is incomprehensible that he should not exist.::Blaise Pascal
The knowledge of God is very far from the love of Him.::Blaise Pascal
I have made this letter longer than usual, only because I have not had the time to make it shorter.::Blaise Pascal
It is not good to be too free. It is not good to have everything one wants.::Blaise Pascal
The sensitivity of men to small matters, and their indifference to great ones, indicates a strange inversion.::Blaise Pascal
The least movement is of importance to all nature. The entire ocean is affected by a pebble.::Blaise Pascal
Man is but a reed, the most feeble thing in nature, but he is a thinking reed.::Blaise Pascal
In faith there is enough light for those who want to believe and enough shadows to blind those who don't.::Blaise Pascal
Jesus is the God whom we can approach without pride and before whom we can humble ourselves without despair.::Blaise Pascal
Custom is our nature. What are our natural principles but principles of custom?::Blaise Pascal
The finite is annihilated in the presence of the infinite, and becomes a pure nothing. So our spirit before God, so our justice before divine justice.::Blaise Pascal
Nothing is so intolerable to man as being fully at rest, without a passion, without business, without entertainment, without care.::Blaise Pascal
All men's miseries derive from not being able to sit in a quiet room alone.::Blaise Pascal
The charm of fame is so great that we like every object to which it is attached, even death.::Blaise Pascal
The strength of a man's virtue should not be measured by his special exertions, but by his habitual acts.::Blaise Pascal
Truth is so obscure in these times, and falsehood so established, that, unless we love the truth, we cannot know it.::Blaise Pascal
We like security: we like the pope to be infallible in matters of faith, and grave doctors to be so in moral questions so that we can feel reassured.::Blaise Pascal
Too much and too little wine. Give him none, he cannot find truth give him too much, the same.::Blaise Pascal
It is the fight alone that pleases us, not the victory.::Blaise Pascal
When we are in love we seem to ourselves quite different from what we were before.::Blaise Pascal
Habit is a second nature that destroys the first. But what is nature? Why is habit not natural? I am very much afraid that nature itself is only a first habit, just as habit is a second nature.::Blaise Pascal
Nature is an infinite sphere of which the center is everywhere and the circumference nowhere.::Blaise Pascal
Thus so wretched is man that he would weary even without any cause for weariness... and so frivolous is he that, though full of a thousand reasons for weariness, the least thing, such as playing billiards or hitting a ball, is sufficient enough to amuse him.::Blaise Pascal
He that takes truth for his guide, and duty for his end, may safely trust to God's providence to lead him aright.::Blaise Pascal
Belief is a wise wager. Granted that faith cannot be proved, what harm will come to you if you gamble on its truth and it proves false? If you gain, you gain all if you lose, you lose nothing. Wager, then, without hesitation, that He exists.::Blaise Pascal
If we must not act save on a certainty, we ought not to act on religion, for it is not certain. But how many things we do on an uncertainty, sea voyages, battles!::Blaise Pascal
Justice and truth are too such subtle points that our tools are too blunt to touch them accurately.::Blaise Pascal
Justice and power must be brought together, so that whatever is just may be powerful, and whatever is powerful may be just.::Blaise Pascal
Happiness is neither without us nor within us. It is in God, both without us and within us.::Blaise Pascal
That we must love one God only is a thing so evident that it does not require miracles to prove it.::Blaise Pascal
In each action we must look beyond the action at our past, present, and future state, and at others whom it affects, and see the relations of all those things. And then we shall be very cautious.::Blaise Pascal
We know the truth, not only by the reason, but also by the heart.::Blaise Pascal
Faith is different from proof the latter is human, the former is a Gift from God.::Blaise Pascal
There are two kinds of people one can call reasonable: those who serve God with all their heart because they know him, and those who seek him with all their heart because they do not know him.::Blaise Pascal
If we examine our thoughts, we shall find them always occupied with the past and the future.::Blaise Pascal
It's been my experience that every time I think I know where it's at, it's usually somewhere else.::Blake Edwards
Nothing matters but the facts. Without them, the science of criminal investigation is nothing more than a guessing game.::Blake Edwards
I think that age as a number is not nearly as important as health. You can be in poor health and be pretty miserable at 40 or 50. If you're in good health, you can enjoy things into your 80s.::Bob Barker
We had a strong relationship with Walter Brown, and felt that he was the best owner in the league.::Bob Cousy
I've thought about it, not a lot, but I thought my relationship with Congress - the Democrats and Republicans - would help me get some things done. Not everything, but at least they'd be willing to try.::Bob Dole
The internet is a great way to get on the net.::Bob Dole
You feel a little older in the morning. By noon I feel about 55.::Bob Dole
Baseball is only a game, a game of inches and a lot of luck. During a time of all-out war, sports are very insignificant.::Bob Feller
Sympathy is something that shouldn't be bestowed upon the Yankees. Apparently it angers them.::Bob Feller
There was great leadership in this country at the time of World War II. There was also unrelenting resolve at home, in America's factories and on the farms, in the cities and the country.::Bob Feller
Every day is a new opportunity. You can build on yesterday's success or put its failures behind and start over again. That's the way life is, with a new game every day, and that's the way baseball is.::Bob Feller
If you believe your catcher is intelligent and you know that he has considerable experience, it is a good thing to leave the game almost entirely in his hands.::Bob Feller
I have had national security background, 10 years on the Intelligence Committee, the last two years as chair.::Bob Graham
This president has been reluctant to hold anybody accountable. No one was held accountable after September the 11th. Nobody's been held accountable after the clear flaws in intelligence leading up to the war in Iraq.::Bob Graham
A significant number of pages and sentences that the administration wants to keep in a classified status have already been released publicly, some of it by public statements of the leadership of the CIA and the FBI.::Bob Graham
We need to make a greater investment in human intelligence.::Bob Graham
Today 80 percent of all the oil that comes out of the Gulf is from 1,000 feet or more and today almost a third of it is more than 5,000 feet below the surface. What hasn't happened is the safety and the ability to respond to a negative event such as this blowout, has been far outrun by the technology of drilling itself. We need to close that gap.::Bob Graham
The president has undermined trust. No longer will the members of Congress be entitled to accept his veracity. Caveat emptor has become the word. Every member of Congress is on his or her own to determine the truth.::Bob Graham
During the Cold War, we gathered information by listening to the Soviets, taking pictures of the Soviets, and we allowed our human intelligence to decline.::Bob Graham
We ought to recognize that we have an offensive responsibility to take the war to the terrorists where they are. That responsibility has waned in the last year as military and intelligence resources were withdrawn from Afghanistan and Pakistan to be used in Iraq.::Bob Graham
My point was that the war was intrinsically wrong, and as a result of our participation we haven't improved Australia's security but created a greater danger at home and abroad.::Bob Hawke
You know you're getting old when the candles cost more than the cake.::Bob Hope
People who throw kisses are hopelessly lazy.::Bob Hope
I have too much money invested in sweaters.::Bob Hope
I don't feel old. I don't feel anything till noon. That's when it's time for my nap.::Bob Hope
If you watch a game, it's fun. If you play it, it's recreation. If you work at it, it's golf.::Bob Hope
If I have to lay an egg for my country, I'll do it.::Bob Hope
The trees in Siberia are miles apart, that is why the dogs are so fast.::Bob Hope
A bank is a place that will lend you money if you can prove that you don't need it.::Bob Hope
A James Cagney love scene is one where he lets the other guy live.::Bob Hope
Middle age is when your age starts to show around your middle.::Bob Hope
If you haven't got any charity in your heart, you have the worst kind of heart trouble.::Bob Hope
I love to go to Washington - if only to be near my money.::Bob Hope
When we recall the past, we usually find that it is the simplest things - not the great occasions - that in retrospect give off the greatest glow of happiness.::Bob Hope
A sense of humor is good for you. Have you ever heard of a laughing hyena with heart burn?::Bob Hope
I intend to explode the myths about myself and get down to the real truth about the legend that is Batman.::Bob Kane
Although Bill Finger literally typed the scripts in the early days, he wrote the scripts from ideas that we mutually collaborated on. Many of the unique concepts and story twists also came from my own fertile imagination.::Bob Kane
It requires more strength to be gentle, so it's the everyday encounters of life that I think we've prepared children for and prepared them to be good to other people and to consider other people.::Bob Keeshan
The two most important things in life are good friends and a strong bullpen.::Bob Lemon
I really don't know what makes a comedian. I think it's a family background and environment. Yet if you put the same ingredients in another person, he may never utter a funny line.::Bob Newhart
I think one reason for a successful marriage is laughter. I think laughter gets you through the rough moments in a marriage.::Bob Newhart
I was never a Certified Public Accountant. I just had a degree in accounting. It would require passing a test, which I would not have been able to do.::Bob Newhart
I don't like country music, but I don't mean to denigrate those who do. And for the people who like country music, denigrate means 'put down'.::Bob Newhart
Funny is funny is funny.::Bob Newhart
I don't know how many sacred cows there are today. I think there's a little confusion between humor and gross passing for humor. That's kind of regrettable.::Bob Newhart
I'm most proud of the longevity of my marriage, my kids, and my grandchildren. If you don't have that, you really don't have very much.::Bob Newhart
Judgment comes from experience and great judgment comes from bad experience.::Bob Packwood
Ingenuity, plus courage, plus work, equals miracles.::Bob Richards
American politics used to be an amateur sport. But somewhere along the way, we handed over to professionals all the things people used to do for free.::Bob Schieffer
The government's view is that the best time to announce bad news, news that it doesn't want the public to dwell on is late on a Friday, when it will wind up in the Saturday papers, which if you were readers, then the week day editions. A holiday weekend is even better.::Bob Schieffer
The truth is the Super Bowl long ago became more than just a football game. It's part of our culture like turkey at Thanksgiving and lights at Christmas, and like those holidays beyond their meaning, a factor in our economy.::Bob Schieffer
The Iraq war was fought by one-half of one percent of us. And unless we were part of that small group or had a relative who was, we went about our lives as usual most of the time: no draft, no new taxes, no changes. Not so for the small group who fought the war and their families.::Bob Schieffer
I make fun of situations and try and find the humor in things, but it's never at the expense of the other guy.::Bob Uecker
I hope the fans have enjoyed listening as much as I've enjoyed doing the games. I don't ever go to the park where I don't have a good day. I don't like losing. But I don't think I ever go to the park where I have a bad day. I don't think once.::Bob Uecker
The biggest thrill a ballplayer can have is when your son takes after you. That happened when my Bobby was in his championship Little League game. He really showed me something. Struck out three times. Made an error that lost the game. Parents were throwing things at our car and swearing at us as we drove off. Gosh, I was proud.::Bob Uecker
I set records that will never be equaled. In fact, I hope 90% of them don't even get printed.::Bob Uecker
He doesn't know the meaning of the word fear, but then again he doesn't know the meaning of most words.::Bobby Bowden
To have the kind of year you want to have, something has to happen that you can't explain why it happened. Something has to happen that you can't coach.::Bobby Bowden
My family comes first. Maybe that's what makes me different from other guys.::Bobby Darin
Everybody, sooner or later, will have to go under the knife. Let's hope they make out as well as I did.::Bobby Darin

I can't sit down long enough to absorb any kind of learning.::Buddy Rich
But, I don't think any arranger should ever write a drum part for a drummer because if a drummer can't create his own Interpretation of the chart and he plays everything that's written, he becomes mechanical he has no freedom.::Buddy Rich
I think the drummer should sit back there and play some drums, and never mind about the tunes. Just get up there and wail behind whoever is sitting up there playing the solo. And this is what is lacking, definitely lacking in music today.::Buddy Rich
But I think that any young drummer starting out today should get himself a great teacher and learn all there is to know about the instrument that he wants to play.::Buddy Rich

It is great power that has been entrusted to your keeping which charges you with the high responsibility of inspiring and ennobling the commercial world. It is all part of the greater work of the regeneration and redemption of mankind.::Calvin Coolidge
I have found it advisable not to give too much heed to what people say when I am trying to accomplish something of consequence. Invariably they proclaim it can't be done. I deem that the very best time to make the effort.::Calvin Coolidge
If I had permitted my failures, or what seemed to me at the time a lack of success, to discourage me I cannot see any way in which I would ever have made progress.::Calvin Coolidge
Don't expect to build up the weak by pulling down the strong.::Calvin Coolidge

The government of the United States is a device for maintaining in perpetuity the rights of the people, with the ultimate extinction of all privileged classes.::Calvin Coolidge
Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers. It may not be difficult to store up in the mind a vast quantity of facts within a comparatively short time, but the ability to form judgments requires the severe discipline of hard work and the tempering heat of experience and maturity.::Calvin Coolidge
When large numbers of men are unable to find work, unemployment results.::Calvin Coolidge
Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not: nothing is more common than unsuccessful people with talent. Genius will not: unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not: the world is full of educated failures. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.::Calvin Coolidge
Perhaps one of the most important accomplishments of my administration has been minding my own business.::Calvin Coolidge
It takes a great man to be a good listener.::Calvin Coolidge
It is only when men begin to worship that they begin to grow.::Calvin Coolidge
After all, the chief business of the American people is business. They are profoundly concerned with producing, buying, selling, investing and prospering in the world.::Calvin Coolidge
Christmas is not a time nor a season, but a state of mind. To cherish peace and goodwill, to be plenteous in mercy, is to have the real spirit of Christmas.::Calvin Coolidge
No enterprise can exist for itself alone. It ministers to some great need, it performs some great service, not for itself, but for others or failing therein, it ceases to be profitable and ceases to exist.::Calvin Coolidge
There's always a source for humor.::Calvin Trillin
I never did very well in math - I could never seem to persuade the teacher that I hadn't meant my answers literally.::Calvin Trillin
I actually think of being funny as an odd turn of mind, like a mild disability, some weird way of looking at the world that you can't get rid of.::Calvin Trillin
We all know funny people who can't get it down on the page - even funny writers who can't get it down on the page.::Calvin Trillin

The most remarkable thing about my mother is that for thirty years she served the family nothing but leftovers. The original meal has never been found.::Calvin Trillin
With humor, it's so subjective that trying to think of what the ideal reader would think would drive you crazy.::Calvin Trillin
When it comes to Chinese food I have always operated under the policy that the less known about the preparation the better. A wise diner who is invited to visit the kitchen replies by saying, as politely as possible, that he has a pressing engagement elsewhere.::Calvin Trillin
I will never forget my beautiful days with you in Shanklin, they are certainly the most pleasant ones of my life. Look, I have tears in my eyes just to think about it. I am furious to be here, it is the end of happiness for a whole year.::Camille Claudel
Don't fear anything for your letters, they are burnt one by one and I hope you do the same with mine.::Camille Claudel
You promised to take care of me and not to turn your back on me. How is it possible that you never wrote to me even once and you never came back to see me? Do you think that it is fun for me to spend months, even years, without any news, without any hope!::Camille Claudel
I sometimes have a horrible fear of turning up a canvas of mine. I'm always afraid of finding a monster in place of the precious jewels I thought I had put there!::Camille Pissarro
I began to understand my sensations, to know what I wanted, at around the age of forty - but only vaguely.::Camille Pissarro
Don't be afraid in nature: one must be bold, at the risk of having been deceived and making mistakes.::Camille Pissarro

Life stands before me like an eternal spring with new and brilliant clothes.::Carl Friedrich Gauss
Knowledge rests not upon truth alone, but upon error also.::Carl Jung
One looks back with appreciation to the brilliant teachers, but with gratitude to those who touched our human feelings. The curriculum is so much necessary raw material, but warmth is the vital element for the growing plant and for the soul of the child.::Carl Jung
Man needs difficulties they are necessary for health.::Carl Jung
We should not pretend to understand the world only by the intellect. The judgement of the intellect is only part of the truth.::Carl Jung

The debt we owe to the play of imagination is incalculable.::Carl Jung
Where love rules, there is no will to power and where power predominates, there love is lacking. The one is the shadow of the other.::Carl Jung
All the works of man have their origin in creative fantasy. What right have we then to depreciate imagination.::Carl Jung
Your vision will become clear only when you can look into your own heart. Who looks outside, dreams who looks inside, awakes.::Carl Jung

We cannot change anything until we accept it. Condemnation does not liberate, it oppresses.::Carl Jung
We are born at a given moment, in a given place and, like vintage years of wine, we have the qualities of the year and of the season of which we are born. Astrology does not lay claim to anything more.::Carl Jung
Who looks outside, dreams who looks inside, awakes.::Carl Jung
A 'scream' is always just that - a noise and not music.::Carl Jung
The word 'happiness' would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness.::Carl Jung
Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness. It is far better take things as they come along with patience and equanimity.::Carl Jung
If the money we donate helps one child or can ease the pain of one parent, those funds are well spent.::Carl Karcher
Dr. Rice's record on Iraq gives me great concern. In her public statements she clearly overstated and exaggerated the intelligence concerning Iraq before the war in order to support the President's decision to initiate military action against Iraq.::Carl Levin
Even top caliber hospitals cannot escape medical mistakes that sometimes result in irreparable damage to patients.::Carl Levin
When a decision is made to go to war based on intelligence, it is a fateful decision. It has ramifications and impacts way beyond the current months and years.::Carl Levin
The intelligence failures with respect to Iraq were massive and have damaged our credibility around the world.::Carl Levin
If we have a chance of succeeding and bringing stability and democracy to Iraq, it will mean learning from our mistakes, not denying them and not ignoring them.::Carl Levin

The good life is a process, not a state of being. It is a direction not a destination.::Carl Rogers
In my early professional years I was asking the question: How can I treat, or cure, or change this person? Now I would phrase the question in this way: How can I provide a relationship which this person may use for his own personal growth?::Carl Rogers
The only person who is educated is the one who has learned how to learn and change.::Carl Rogers
I believe that the testing of the student's achievements in order to see if he meets some criterion held by the teacher, is directly contrary to the implications of therapy for significant learning.::Carl Rogers
The curious paradox is that when I accept myself just as I am, then I can change.::Carl Rogers

A celibate clergy is an especially good idea, because it tends to suppress any hereditary propensity toward fanaticism.::Carl Sagan
We've arranged a civilization in which most crucial elements profoundly depend on science and technology.::Carl Sagan
We have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology. This is a prescription for disaster. We might get away with it for a while, but sooner or later this combustible mixture of ignorance and power is going to blow up in our faces.::Carl Sagan
Science is a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge.::Carl Sagan
We live in a society exquisitely dependent on science and technology, in which hardly anyone knows anything about science and technology.::Carl Sagan
If we long to believe that the stars rise and set for us, that we are the reason there is a Universe, does science do us a disservice in deflating our conceits?::Carl Sagan
I am often amazed at how much more capability and enthusiasm for science there is among elementary school youngsters than among college students.::Carl Sagan
The brain is like a muscle. When it is in use we feel very good. Understanding is joyous.::Carl Sagan
All of the books in the world contain no more information than is broadcast as video in a single large American city in a single year. Not all bits have equal value.::Carl Sagan
Personally, I would be delighted if there were a life after death, especially if it permitted me to continue to learn about this world and others, if it gave me a chance to discover how history turns out.::Carl Sagan
Skeptical scrutiny is the means, in both science and religion, by which deep thoughts can be winnowed from deep nonsense.::Carl Sagan

I have always felt that a woman has the right to treat the subject of her age with ambiguity until, perhaps, she passes into the realm of over ninety. Then it is better she be candid with herself and with the world.::Carl Sandburg
To work hard, to live hard, to die hard, and then go to hell after all would be too damn hard.::Carl Sandburg
Anger is the most impotent of passions. It effects nothing it goes about, and hurts the one who is possessed by it more than the one against whom it is directed.::Carl Sandburg
I learned you can't trust the judgment of good friends.::Carl Sandburg
Nearly all the best things that came to me in life have been unexpected, unplanned by me.::Carl Sandburg

I'm an idealist. I don't know where I'm going, but I'm on my way.::Carl Sandburg
When a nation goes down, or a society perishes, one condition may always be found they forgot where they came from. They lost sight of what had brought them along.::Carl Sandburg
Life is like an onion. You peel it off one layer at a time, and sometimes you weep.::Carl Sandburg
The sea speaks a language polite people never repeat. It is a colossal scavenger slang and has no respect.::Carl Sandburg
Poetry is an echo, asking a shadow to dance.::Carl Sandburg
To be a good loser is to learn how to win.::Carl Sandburg

From the equality of rights springs identity of our highest interests you cannot subvert your neighbor's rights without striking a dangerous blow at your own.::Carl Schurz
As an inspiration to the author, I do not think the cat can be over-estimated. He suggests so much grace, power, beauty, motion, mysticism. I do not wonder that many writers love cats I am only surprised that all do not.::Carl Van Vechten
I think about baseball when I wake up in the morning. I think about it all day and I dream about it at night. The only time I don't think about it is when I'm playing it.::Carl Yastrzemski
I got started when I was 3 years old because my father was a music teacher and my lessons were free. Instead of learning to walk, you learn to play the piano.::Carla Bley
When you are studying jazz, the best thing to do is listen to records or listen to live music. It isn't as though you go to a teacher. You just listen as much as you can and absorb everything.::Carla Bley
It's amazing how fast generations lose sight of other generations. One of the first things the young composers who come to work with me say is that they want to write music people will like, instead of gaining their credentials by being rejected by the audience.::Carlisle Floyd
Italy advocates the adoption of a legal instrument on cultural diversity, guaranteeing every country the protection of its own historical identity and the uniqueness of its physical and intangible cultural heritage.::Carlo Azeglio Ciampi

A man of knowledge lives by acting, not by thinking about acting.::Carlos Castaneda
To achieve the mood of a warrior is not a simple matter. It is a revolution. To regard the lion and the water rats and our fellow men as equals is a magnificent act of a warrior's spirit. It takes power to do that.::Carlos Castaneda
I use a lot of film images, analogies, and imagination.::Carlos Fuentes
I don't think any good book is based on factual experience. Bad books are about things the writer already knew before he wrote them.::Carlos Fuentes
I am not interested in slice of life, what I want is a slice of the imagination.::Carlos Fuentes
You have an absolute freedom in Mexican writing today in which you don't necessarily have to deal with the Mexican identity. You know why? Because we have an identity... We know who we are. We know what it means to be a Mexican.::Carlos Fuentes
I had the good fortune of having a happy, closely knit family.::Carlos Fuentes
I am a morning writer I am writing at eight-thirty in longhand and I keep at it until twelve-thirty, when I go for a swim. Then I come back, have lunch, and read in the afternoon until I take my walk for the next day's writing.::Carlos Fuentes
Literature overtakes history, for literature gives you more than one life. It expands experience and opens new opportunities to readers.::Carlos Fuentes
I've chosen my wedding ring large and heavy to continue forever. But exactly because of that all the time that Dave and I have an argument I feel it like handcuffs, and on anger time I throw it in a basket. Poor Dave, he bought me three wedding rings already!::Carmen Miranda
I'm glad I was born when I was. My time was the golden age of variety. If I were starting out again now, maybe things would happen for me, but it certainly would not be on a variety show with 28 musicians, 12 dancers, two major guest stars, 50 costumes a week by Bob Mackie. The networks just wouldn't spend the money today.::Carol Burnett
But I don't begrudge anybody, because I know how hard it is to have that dream and to make it happen, whether or not it's just to put a roof over your head and food on the table.::Carol Burnett
Adolescence is just one big walking pimple.::Carol Burnett
But I didn't ask to have somebody nose around in my private life. I didn't even ask to be famous. All I asked was to be able to earn a living making people laugh.::Carol Burnett
It costs a lot to sue a magazine, and it's too bad that we don't have a system where the losing team has to pay the winning team's lawyers.::Carol Burnett
I wish my mother had left me something about how she felt growing up. I wish my grandmother had done the same. I wanted my girls to know me.::Carol Burnett
Only I can change my life. No one can do it for me.::Carol Burnett
We don't stop going to school when we graduate.::Carol Burnett
You have to go through the falling down in order to learn to walk. It helps to know that you can survive it. That's an education in itself.::Carol Burnett
My interesting diet tips are eat early and don't nosh between meals. I mean, I can pack it away.::Carol Burnett
Words, once they are printed, have a life of their own.::Carol Burnett
My grandmother and I saw an average of eight movies a week, double features, second run.::Carol Burnett
In the different voice of women lies the truth of an ethic of care, the tie between relationship and responsibility, and the origins of aggression in the failure of connection.::Carol Gilligan
At a time when efforts are being made to eradicate discrimination between the sexes in the search for social equality and justice, the differences between the sexes are being rediscovered.::Carol Gilligan

I enjoyed in every way my 12 years of playing Archie, and I wasn't personally sad about finishing a long job.::Carroll O'Connor
One irreducible residual of 38 years in the business is the number of lasting, loving friendships I have made.::Carroll O'Connor
Even a true artist does not always produce art.::Carroll O'Connor
Vulgar and obscene, the papers run rumors daily about people in show business, tales of wicked ways and witless affairs.::Carroll O'Connor
All in the Family was intellectual it was art.::Carroll O'Connor
Half the pictures directed by men of reputation fail.::Carroll O'Connor
Sheer flattery got me into the theater. Flattery always works with me, particularly the flattery of women.::Carroll O'Connor
In a capitalist society, persons who create capital, like Michael Eisner, are given the staggering rewards.::Carroll O'Connor
Both my brothers became physicians and I, of course, wandered into a business where the undisciplined are welcome.::Carroll O'Connor
Some people thought we were presenting Archie as a false character. President Nixon thought we were making a fool out of a good man.::Carroll O'Connor
I've run into some S.O.B. directors, but I gave them back as good as I got.::Carroll O'Connor
I have heard show business characterized as a refuge for childlike persons in flight from all things harsh and real.::Carroll O'Connor
The traditional Christian attitude toward human personality was that human nature was essentially good and that it was formed and modified by social pressures and training.::Carroll Quigley
This persistence as private firms continued because it ensured the maximum of anonymity and secrecy to persons of tremendous public power who dreaded public knowledge of their activities as an evil almost as great as inflation.::Carroll Quigley
The failure of Christianity in the areas west from Sicily was even greater, and was increased by the spread of Arab outlooks and influence to that area, and especially to Spain.::Carroll Quigley
Thus, the use of fiat money is more justifiable in financing a depression than in financing a war.::Carroll Quigley
The history of the last century shows, as we shall see later, that the advice given to governments by bankers, like the advice they gave to industrialists, was consistently good for bankers, but was often disastrous for governments, businessmen, and the people generally.::Carroll Quigley
In addition to their power over government based on government financing and personal influence, bankers could steer governments in ways they wished them to go by other pressures.::Carroll Quigley
It's a massive motor in a tiny, lightweight car.::Carroll Shelby
I'm not going to take this defeatist attitude and listen to all this crap any more from all these people who have nothing except doomsday to predict.::Carroll Shelby

The mere imparting of information is not education.::Carter G. Woodson
In fact, the confidence of the people is worth more than money.::Carter G. Woodson
If Liberia has failed, then, it is no evidence of the failure of the Negro in government. It is merely evidence of the failure of slavery.::Carter G. Woodson
If a race has no history, if it has no worthwhile tradition, it becomes a negligible factor in the thought of the world, and it stands in danger of being exterminated.::Carter G. Woodson
The so-called modern education, with all its defects, however, does others so much more good than it does the Negro, because it has been worked out in conformity to the needs of those who have enslaved and oppressed weaker peoples.::Carter G. Woodson
This assumption of Negro leadership in the ghetto, then, must not be confined to matters of religion, education, and social uplift it must deal with such fundamental forces in life as make these things possible.::Carter G. Woodson
And thus goes segregation which is the most far-reaching development in the history of the Negro since the enslavement of the race.::Carter G. Woodson
They still have some money, and they have needs to supply. They must begin immediately to pool their earnings and organize industries to participate in supplying social and economic demands.::Carter G. Woodson
Let us banish fear.::Carter G. Woodson
Negro banks, as a rule, have failed because the people, taught that their own pioneers in business cannot function in this sphere, withdrew their deposits.::Carter G. Woodson
As another has well said, to handicap a student by teaching him that his black face is a curse and that his struggle to change his condition is hopeless is the worst sort of lynching.::Carter G. Woodson
The strongest bank in the United States will last only so long as the people will have sufficient confidence in it to keep their money there.::Carter G. Woodson
In our so-called democracy we are accustomed to give the majority what they want rather than educate them to understand what is best for them.::Carter G. Woodson

Insanity runs in my family. It practically gallops.::Cary Grant
That something extra, I believe, is a certain humanity that comes from upbeat and positive human interest letters and success stories. Advertisers like to be associated with those qualities.::Casey Kasem
You gotta lose 'em some of the time. When you do, lose 'em right.::Casey Stengel
The trouble with women umpires is that I couldn't argue with one. I'd put my arms around her and give her a little kiss.::Casey Stengel
They say Yogi Berra is funny. Well, he has a lovely wife and family, a beautiful home, money in the bank, and he plays golf with millionaires. What's funny about that?::Casey Stengel
Most ball games are lost, not won.::Casey Stengel
Managing is getting paid for home runs that someone else hits.::Casey Stengel
The trick is growing up without growing old.::Casey Stengel

All right everyone, line up alphabetically according to your height.::Casey Stengel
Sure I played, did you think I was born at the age of 70 sitting in a dugout trying to manage guys like you?::Casey Stengel

If we are to better the future we must disturb the present.::Catherine Booth
I had only two offers of marriage in my life, and I refused both.::Catherine Helen Spence

Real education should consist of drawing the goodness and the best out of our own students. What better books can there be than the book of humanity?::Cesar Chavez
From the depth of need and despair, people can work together, can organize themselves to solve their own problems and fill their own needs with dignity and strength.::Cesar Chavez
When we are really honest with ourselves we must admit our lives are all that really belong to us. So it is how we use our lives that determines the kind of men we are.::Cesar Chavez
Who gets the risks? The risks are given to the consumer, the unsuspecting consumer and the poor work force. And who gets the benefits? The benefits are only for the corporations, for the money makers.::Cesar Chavez

New Year's Day is every man's birthday.::Charles Lamb

The man who has done his best has done everything.::Charles M. Schwab
A man to carry on a successful business must have imagination. He must see things as in a vision, a dream of the whole thing.::Charles M. Schwab
I don't live for poetry. I live far more than anybody else does.::Charles Olson
You don't help people in your poems. I've been trying to help people all my life - that's my trouble.::Charles Olson
This morning of the small snow I count the blessings, the leak in the faucet which makes of the sink time, the drop of the water on water.::Charles Olson
If there's no relationship with a father who's absent, nobody talks about it.::Charles Rangel
The Klan had used fear, intimidation and murder to brutally oppress over African-Americans who sought justice and equality and it sought to respond to the young workers of the civil rights movement in Mississippi in the same way.::Charles Rangel
I, for one, would think both about how far we have come as a country and how much further we need to go to erase racism and discrimination from our society.::Charles Rangel
I'm just glad that my community has faith and confidence in me.::Charles Rangel
Full participation in government and society has been a basic right of the country symbolizing the full citizenship and equal protection of all.::Charles Rangel
Now is the time for the U.S. and the nations of Western Europe who engaged in the slave trade throughout this hemisphere to come forward in a positive way to assist in undoing the harm that was caused by their past colonial policies in the hemisphere.::Charles Rangel
For a member to say, 'I'm a lame duck' violates political science 101.::Charles Rangel
If you can't change your fate, change your attitude.::Charles Revson
Doubt is an uneasy and dissatisfied state from which we struggle to free ourselves and pass into the state of belief while the latter is a calm and satisfactory state which we do not wish to avoid, or to change to a belief in anything else.::Charles Sanders Peirce
You often feel that your prayers scarcely reach the ceiling but, oh, get into this humble spirit by considering how good the Lord is, and how evil you all are, and then prayer will mount on wings of faith to heaven.::Charles Simeon
Poetry is an orphan of silence. The words never quite equal the experience behind them.::Charles Simic
Wanted: a needle swift enough to sew this poem into a blanket.::Charles Simic
There was endless action - not just football, but sailboats, tennis and other things: movement. There was endless talk - the ambassador at the head of the table laying out the prevailing wisdom, but everyone else weighing in with their opinions and taking part.::Charles Spalding
Saving faith is an immediate relation to Christ, accepting, receiving, resting upon Him alone, for justification, sanctification, and eternal life by virtue of God's grace.::Charles Spurgeon
A good character is the best tombstone. Those who loved you and were helped by you will remember you when forget-me-nots have withered. Carve your name on hearts, not on marble.::Charles Spurgeon
It's not the having, it's the getting.::Charles Spurgeon
I believe that nothing happens apart from divine determination and decree. We shall never be able to escape from the doctrine of divine predestination - the doctrine that God has foreordained certain people unto eternal life.::Charles Spurgeon
It is not how much we have, but how much we enjoy, that makes happiness.::Charles Spurgeon
Many men owe the grandeur of their lives to their tremendous difficulties.::Charles Spurgeon
Wisdom is the right use of knowledge. To know is not to be wise. Many men know a great deal, and are all the greater fools for it. There is no fool so great a fool as a knowing fool. But to know how to use knowledge is to have wisdom.::Charles Spurgeon
It is not well to make great changes in old age.::Charles Spurgeon
I would go to the deeps a hundred times to cheer a downcast spirit. It is good for me to have been afflicted, that I might know how to speak a word in season to one that is weary.::Charles Spurgeon
A vigorous temper is not altogether an evil. Men who are easy as an old shoe are generally of little worth.::Charles Spurgeon
The Lord gets his best soldiers out of the highlands of affliction.::Charles Spurgeon
The greatest enemy to human souls is the self-righteous spirit which makes men look to themselves for salvation.::Charles Spurgeon
If any of you should ask me for an epitome of the Christian religion, I should say that it is in one word - prayer. Live and die without prayer, and you will pray long enough when you get to hell.::Charles Spurgeon
Anxiety does not empty tomorrow of its sorrows, but only empties today of its strength.::Charles Spurgeon
A lie can travel half way around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes.::Charles Spurgeon
We have come to a turning point in the road. If we turn to the right mayhap our children and our children's children will go that way but if we turn to the left, generations yet unborn will curse our names for having been unfaithful to God and to His Word.::Charles Spurgeon
In giving us children, God places us in a position of both leadership and service. He calls us to give up our lives for someone else's sake - to abandon our own desires and put our child's interests first. Yet, according to His perfect design, it is through this selflessness that we can become truly fulfilled.::Charles Stanley
I'm convinced that the man who has learned to meditate upon the Lord will be able to run on his feet and walk in his spirit. Although he may be hurried by his vocation, that's not the issue. The issue is how fast his spirit is going. To slow it down takes a period of time.::Charles Stanley
You can't tell a woman who is called by God to teach that she cannot teach the Word of God... So I think the distinction is that there's a difference between the authority of a pastor and a Bible teacher.::Charles Stanley
God's voice is still and quiet and easily buried under an avalanche of clamour.::Charles Stanley
He wants you all to Himself to put His loving, divine arms around you.::Charles Stanley
The moment someone chooses to trust in Jesus Christ, his sins are wiped away, and he is adopted into God's family. That individual is set apart as a child of God, with a sacred purpose.::Charles Stanley
The best way in the world to deceive believers is to cloak a message in religious language and declare that it conveys some new insight from God.::Charles Stanley
The Bible tells us that God will meet all our needs. He feeds the birds of the air and clothes the grass with the splendor of lilies. How much more, then, will He care for us, who are made in His image? Our only concern is to obey the heavenly Father and leave the consequences to Him.::Charles Stanley
There is only one secure foundation: a genuine, deep relationship with Jesus Christ, which will carry you through any and all turmoil. No matter what storms are raging all around, you'll stand firm if you stand on His love.::Charles Stanley
We can be tired, weary and emotionally distraught, but after spending time alone with God, we find that He injects into our bodies energy, power and strength.::Charles Stanley
God has ways of shaking the world when He is at work. He literally caused the ground to quake when Jesus died on the cross.::Charles Stanley
If we have built on the fragile cornerstones of human wisdom, pride, and conditional love, things may look good for a while, but a weak foundation causes collapse when storms hit.::Charles Stanley
Our heavenly Father understands our disappointment, suffering, pain, fear, and doubt. He is always there to encourage our hearts and help us understand that He's sufficient for all of our needs. When I accepted this as an absolute truth in my life, I found that my worrying stopped.::Charles Stanley
You have to have courage to be obedient to God.::Charles Stanley
I certainly respect other people's opinions, but I would not vote for a woman to be the pastor of a church.::Charles Stanley
Earthly wisdom is doing what comes naturally. Godly wisdom is doing what the Holy Spirit compels us to do.::Charles Stanley
Helping someone come to a saving knowledge of Christ is the greatest achievement possible.::Charles Stanley
Think about the comfortable feeling you have as you open your front door. That's but a hint of what we'll feel some day on arriving at the place our Father has lovingly and personally prepared for us in heaven.::Charles Stanley
I think a lot of people, even Christians, are willing to be satisfied with gaining lots and lots of biblical knowledge - and many people go to Bible studies and don't realize it isn't enough to know what's right, it's applying the information and the knowledge that you have.::Charles Stanley
God will never direct us to be prideful, arrogant and unforgiving, immoral or slothful or full of fear. We step into these things because we are insensitive to the leadership of the Holy Spirit within us.::Charles Stanley
God will never tell us to do something that gratifies the flesh.::Charles Stanley
Too many Christians have a commitment of convenience. They'll stay faithful as long as it's safe and doesn't involve risk, rejection, or criticism. Instead of standing alone in the face of challenge or temptation, they check to see which way their friends are going.::Charles Stanley
Hope founded upon a human being, a man-made philosophy or any institution is always misplaced... because these things are unreliable and fleeting.::Charles Stanley
The Scriptures contain many stories of people who waited years or even decades before the Lord's promises came to pass. What modern believers can learn from the patience of biblical saints like Abraham, Joseph, David, and Paul is that waiting upon the Lord has eternal rewards.::Charles Stanley
When God speaks, oftentimes His voice will call for an act of courage on our part.::Charles Stanley
When we take our eyes off the whirl of day-to-day activity and concentrate on honoring Him and following in His way, we find a consistent peace that carries us through both plenty and poverty.::Charles Stanley
Disappointment is inevitable. But to become discouraged, there's a choice I make. God would never discourage me. He would always point me to himself to trust him. Therefore, my discouragement is from Satan. As you go through the emotions that we have, hostility is not from God, bitterness, unforgiveness, all of these are attacks from Satan.::Charles Stanley
Motherhood is a great honor and privilege, yet it is also synonymous with servanthood. Every day women are called upon to selflessly meet the needs of their families. Whether they are awake at night nursing a baby, spending their time and money on less-than-grateful teenagers, or preparing meals, moms continuously put others before themselves.::Charles Stanley
If the Lord says to give more than you think you are able to give, know that He will provide for you. Whether things are sailing smoothly or the bottom has dropped out, He is always trustworthy. You can count on Almighty God to keep His everlasting Word.::Charles Stanley
When we learn from experience, the scars of sin can lead us to restoration and a renewed intimacy with God.::Charles Stanley
If you tell God no because He won't explain the reason He wants you to do something, you are actually hindering His blessing. But when you say yes to Him, all of heaven opens to pour out His goodness and reward your obedience. What matters more than material blessings are the things He is teaching us in our spirit.::Charles Stanley
Basically, there are two paths you can walk: faith or fear. It's impossible to simultaneously trust God and not trust God.::Charles Stanley
God's plan for enlarging His kingdom is so simple - one person telling another about the Savior. Yet we're busy and full of excuses. Just remember, someone's eternal destiny is at stake. The joy you'll have when you meet that person in heaven will far exceed any discomfort you felt in sharing the gospel.::Charles Stanley
When trouble comes, focus on God's ability to care for you.::Charles Stanley
Since God knows our future, our personalities, and our capacity to listen, He isn't ever going to say more to us than we can deal with at the moment.::Charles Stanley
Every test, every trial, every heartache that's been significant, I can turn it over and see how God has turned it into good no matter what.::Charles Stanley
The difficulties we face originate from one of three sources. Some are sent to us by the Lord to test our faith, others are the result of Satan's attacks, and still others are due to our own sinful choices.::Charles Stanley
On Sunday morning, I'm not nervous... I can't wait to tell what God wants me to say.::Charles Stanley
The time you spend alone with God will transform your character and increase your devotion. Then your integrity and godly behavior in an unbelieving world will make others long to know the Lord.::Charles Stanley
We are either in the process of resisting God's truth or in the process of being shaped and molded by his truth.::Charles Stanley
An unschooled man who knows how to meditate upon the Lord has learned far more than the man with the highest education who does not know how to meditate.::Charles Stanley
Fear stifles our thinking and actions. It creates indecisiveness that results in stagnation. I have known talented people who procrastinate indefinitely rather than risk failure. Lost opportunities cause erosion of confidence, and the downward spiral begins.::Charles Stanley
To have God speak to the heart is a majestic experience, an experience that people may miss if they monopolize the conversation and never pause to hear God's responses.::Charles Stanley
Now it is evident that a little insight into the customs of every people is necessary to insure a kindly communication this, joined with patience and kindness, will seldom fail with the natives of the interior.::Charles Sturt
No true and permanent fame can be founded except in labors which promote the happiness of mankind.::Charles Sumner
The last part, the part you're now approaching, was for Aristotle the most important for happiness.::Charles Van Doren
Some of you read with me 40 years ago a portion of Aristotle's Ethics, a selection of passages that describe his idea of happiness. You may not remember too well.::Charles Van Doren
As man sows, so shall he reap. In works of fiction, such men are sometimes converted. More often, in real life, they do not change their natures until they are converted into dust.::Charles W. Chesnutt
There's time enough, but none to spare.::Charles W. Chesnutt
Lawsuit abuse is a major contributor to the increased costs of healthcare, goods and services to consumers.::Charles W. Pickering
A healthy democracy requires a decent society it requires that we are honorable, generous, tolerant and respectful.::Charles W. Pickering
Faith, mighty faith, the promise sees, And looks to God alone Laughs at impossibilities, And cries it shall be done.::Charles Wesley
Go, forget me - why should sorrow, O'er that brow a shadow fling? Go, forget me - and tomorrow, brightly smile and sweetly sing. Smile - though I shall not be near thee Sing - though I shall never hear thee.::Charles Wolfe
You may be sure that the Americans will commit all the stupidities they can think of, plus some that are beyond imagination.::Charles de Gaulle
Patriotism is when love of your own people comes first nationalism, when hate for people other than your own comes first.::Charles de Gaulle
France has lost the battle but she has not lost the war.::Charles de Gaulle
Authority doesn't work without prestige, or prestige without distance.::Charles de Gaulle
It is not tolerable, it is not possible, that from so much death, so much sacrifice and ruin, so much heroism, a greater and better humanity shall not emerge.::Charles de Gaulle
I have come to the conclusion that politics are too serious a matter to be left to the politicians.::Charles de Gaulle
The better I get to know men, the more I find myself loving dogs.::Charles de Gaulle
Old age is a shipwreck.::Charles de Gaulle
I grew up to always respect authority and respect those in charge.::Charles de Gaulle
The sword is the axis of the world and its power is absolute.::Charles de Gaulle
I respect only those who resist me, but I cannot tolerate them.::Charles de Gaulle
In the tumult of men and events, solitude was my temptation now it is my friend. What other satisfaction can be sought once you have confronted History?::Charles de Gaulle
In politics it is necessary either to betray one's country or the electorate. I prefer to betray the electorate.::Charles de Gaulle
Nothing great will ever be achieved without great men, and men are great only if they are determined to be so.::Charles de Gaulle
You'll live. Only the best get killed.::Charles de Gaulle
Deliberation is the work of many men. Action, of one alone.::Charles de Gaulle
Politics is too serious a matter to be left to the politicians.::Charles de Gaulle
The great leaders have always stage-managed their effects.::Charles de Gaulle
Silence is the ultimate weapon of power.::Charles de Gaulle
In order to become the master, the politician poses as the servant.::Charles de Gaulle
I have tried to lift France out of the mud. But she will return to her errors and vomitings. I cannot prevent the French from being French.::Charles de Gaulle
There are two theories on hitting the knuckleball. Unfortunately, neither of them works.::Charley Lau
I don't care what the religion is called as far as I'm concerned, one God, the God I adhere to, is in charge of all of them.::Charley Pride
What we don't need in country music is divisiveness, public criticism of each other, and some arbitrary judgement of what belongs and what doesn't.::Charley Pride
I grew up not liking my father very much. I never saw him cry. But he must have. Everybody cries.::Charley Pride
I was always a dreamer, in childhood especially. People thought I was a little strange.::Charley Pride
The time I spent thinking about how I was better than somebody else or worrying about somebody else's attitude was time I could put to better use.::Charley Pride
Government is inherently incompetent, and no matter what task it is assigned, it will do it in the most expensive and inefficient way possible.::Charley Reese
A person should design the way he makes a living around how he wishes to make a life.::Charlie Byrd
Music's not like becoming a doctor, who can walk into a community and find people who need him.::Charlie Byrd
I went into the business for the money, and the art grew out of it. If people are disillusioned by that remark, I can't help it. It's the truth.::Charlie Chaplin
Life is a tragedy when seen in close-up, but a comedy in long-shot.::Charlie Chaplin
A tramp, a gentleman, a poet, a dreamer, a lonely fellow, always hopeful of romance and adventure.::Charlie Chaplin
To help a friend in need is easy, but to give him your time is not always opportune.::Charlie Chaplin
The saddest thing I can imagine is to get used to luxury.::Charlie Chaplin
Why should poetry have to make sense?::Charlie Chaplin
The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish.::Charlie Chaplin
Man as an individual is a genius. But men in the mass form the headless monster, a great, brutish idiot that goes where prodded.::Charlie Chaplin
I do not have much patience with a thing of beauty that must be explained to be understood. If it does need additional interpretation by someone other than the creator, then I question whether it has fulfilled its purpose.::Charlie Chaplin
Failure is unimportant. It takes courage to make a fool of yourself.::Charlie Chaplin
We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery.::Charlie Chaplin
Movies are a fad. Audiences really want to see live actors on a stage.::Charlie Chaplin
Life could be wonderful if people would leave you alone.::Charlie Chaplin
I am at peace with God. My conflict is with Man.::Charlie Chaplin
I had no idea of the character. But the moment I was dressed, the clothes and the make-up made me feel the person he was. I began to know him, and by the time I walked onto the stage he was fully born.::Charlie Chaplin
The bass, no matter what kind of music you're playing, it just enhances the sound and makes everything sound more beautiful and full. When the bass stops, the bottom kind of drops out of everything.::Charlie Haden
We're here to bring beauty to the world and make a difference in this planet. That's what art forms are about.::Charlie Haden
I just try to play music from my heart and bring as much beauty as I can to as many people as I can. Just give them other alternatives, especially people who aren't exposed to creative music.::Charlie Haden
Music is your own experience, your own thoughts, your wisdom. If you don't live it, it won't come out of your horn. They teach you there's a boundary line to music. But, man, there's no boundary line to art.::Charlie Parker
They teach you there's a boundary line to music. But, man, there's no boundary line to art.::Charlie Parker
The law has no power over heroes.::Charlotte Lennox
The labor of women in the house, certainly, enables men to produce more wealth than they otherwise could and in this way women are economic factors in society. But so are horses.::Charlotte Perkins Gilman
Death? Why this fuss about death? Use your imagination, try to visualize a world without death! Death is the essential condition of life, not an evil.::Charlotte Perkins Gilman
The first duty of a human being is to assume the right functional relationship to society - more briefly, to find your real job, and do it.::Charlotte Perkins Gilman
To attain happiness in another world we need only to believe something, while to secure it in this world we must do something.::Charlotte Perkins Gilman
They very seldom let me lose my cool. They made me like I was Polly Perfect, which was ridiculous so that when I bump into kids on the street they'd say 'I wish my Mom were like you.'::Charlotte Rae
Whatever women do, they must do twice as well as men to be half as good. Luckily, this is not difficult.::Charlotte Whitton
It's how you deal with failure that determines how you achieve success.::Charlotte Whitton
Man cannot live by incompetence alone.::Charlotte Whitton
The trouble with movies as a business is that it's an art, and the trouble with movies as art is that it's a business.::Charlton Heston
Follow the path of the unsafe, independent thinker. Expose your ideas to the dangers of controversy. Speak your mind and fear less the label of 'crackpot' than the stigma of conformity. And on issues that seem important to you, stand up and be counted at any cost.::Chauncey Depew
The accidental causes of science are only accidents relatively to the intelligence of a man.::Chauncey Wright
All observers not laboring under hallucinations of the senses are agreed, or can be made to agree, about facts of sensible experience, through evidence toward which the intellect is merely passive, and over which the individual will and character have no control.::Chauncey Wright
Whenever death may surprise us, let it be welcome if our battle cry has reached even one receptive ear and another hand reaches out to take up our arms.::Che Guevara
Lee's great gifts are teaching and inspirational guidance, not administration and management.::Cheryl Crawford
The extravagant expenditure of public money is an evil not to be measured by the value of that money to the people who are taxed for it.::Chester A. Arthur
God grant me the courage not to give up what I think is right even though I think it is hopeless.::Chester W. Nimitz
Is the proposed operation likely to succeed? What might the consequences of failure? Is it in the realm of practicability in terms of material and supplies?::Chester W. Nimitz
That is not to say that we can relax our readiness to defend ourselves. Our armament must be adequate to the needs, but our faith is not primarily in these machines of defense but in ourselves.::Chester W. Nimitz
My good health is due to a soup made of white doves. It is simply wonderful as a tonic.::Chiang Kai-shek
Prayer is more than meditation. In meditation the source of strength is one's self. When one prays he goes to a source of strength greater than his own.::Chiang Kai-shek
We had good white friends who advised us against taking the war path. My friend and brother, Mr. Chapman, told us just how the war would end.::Chief Joseph
It required a strong heart to stand up against such talk, but I urged my people to be quiet and not to begin a war.::Chief Joseph
We gave up some of our country to the white men, thinking that then we could have peace. We were mistaken. The white man would not let us alone.::Chief Joseph
Treat all men alike. Give them the same law. Give them an even chance to live and grow.::Chief Joseph
It makes my heart sick when I remember all the good words and the broken promises.::Chief Joseph
General Howard informed me, in a haughty spirit, that he would give my people 30 days to go back home, collect all their stock, and move onto the reservation.::Chief Joseph
I only ask of the government to be treated as all other men are treated.::Chief Joseph

If the white man wants to live in peace with the Indian he can live in peace.::Chief Joseph
I know that my race must change.::Chief Joseph
I said in my heart that, rather than have war, I would give up my country.::Chief Joseph
I saw clearly that war was upon us when I learned that my young men had been secretly buying ammunition.::Chief Joseph
I saw that the war could not be prevented. The time had passed.::Chief Joseph
I hope that no more groans of wounded men and women will ever go to the ear of the Great Spirit Chief above, and that all people may be one people.::Chief Joseph
It does not require many words to speak the truth.::Chief Joseph
War can be avoided, and it ought to be avoided. I want no war.::Chief Joseph

People say that if you find water rising up to your ankle, that's the time to do something about it, not when it's around your neck.::Chinua Achebe
Art is man's constant effort to create for himself a different order of reality from that which is given to him.::Chinua Achebe
When a tradition gathers enough strength to go on for centuries, you don't just turn it off one day.::Chinua Achebe
I don't care about age very much.::Chinua Achebe
Nigeria has had a complicated colonial history. My work has examined that part of our story extensively.::Chinua Achebe
A functioning, robust democracy requires a healthy educated, participatory followership, and an educated, morally grounded leadership.::Chinua Achebe
But I liked Yeats! That wild Irishman. I really loved his love of language, his flow. His chaotic ideas seemed to me just the right thing for a poet. Passion! He was always on the right side. He may be wrongheaded, but his heart was always on the right side. He wrote beautiful poetry.::Chinua Achebe
The problem with leaderless uprisings taking over is that you don't always know what you get at the other end. If you are not careful you could replace a bad government with one much worse!::Chinua Achebe
I've had trouble now and again in Nigeria because I have spoken up about the mistreatment of factions in the country because of difference in religion. These are things we should put behind us.::Chinua Achebe
When the British came to Ibo land, for instance, at the beginning of the 20th century, and defeated the men in pitched battles in different places, and set up their administrations, the men surrendered. And it was the women who led the first revolt.::Chinua Achebe
My parents were early converts to Christianity in my part of Nigeria. They were not just converts my father was an evangelist, a religious teacher. He and my mother traveled for thirty-five years to different parts of Igboland, spreading the gospel.::Chinua Achebe
I tell my students, it's not difficult to identify with somebody like yourself, somebody next door who looks like you. What's more difficult is to identify with someone you don't see, who's very far away, who's a different color, who eats a different kind of food. When you begin to do that then literature is really performing its wonders.::Chinua Achebe
In fact, I thought that Christianity was very a good and a very valuable thing for us. But after a while, I began to feel that the story that I was told about this religion wasn't perhaps completely whole, that something was left out.::Chinua Achebe
It's communication - that's what theatre is all about.::Chita Rivera
Beauty is not everything!::Chita Rivera
We were taking collections for people with AIDS in New York around Easter.::Chita Rivera
Southern California, they have been amazing. They're totally with us.::Chita Rivera
In America, life is introverted, self-absorbed - and so is their music.::Chris Barber
Suffering isn't ennobling, recovery is.::Christiaan Barnard
I don't believe medical discoveries are doing much to advance human life. As fast as we create ways to extend it we are inventing ways to shorten it.::Christiaan Barnard
The world is my country, science is my religion.::Christiaan Huygens
Zest is the secret of all beauty. There is no beauty that is attractive without zest.::Christian Dior
Women are most fascinating between the ages of 35 and 40 after they have won a few races and know how to pace themselves. Since few women ever pass 40, maximum fascination can continue indefinitely.::Christian Dior
All species capable of grasping this fact manage better in the struggle for existence than those which rely upon their own strength alone: the wolf, which hunts in a pack, has a greater chance of survival than the lion, which hunts alone.::Christian Lous Lange
Technology is a useful servant but a dangerous master.::Christian Lous Lange
The territorial state is such an ancient form of society - here in Europe it dates back thousands of years - that it is now protected by the sanctity of age and the glory of tradition. A strong religious feeling mingles with the respect and the devotion to the fatherland.::Christian Lous Lange
In particular, the efforts to reestablish peace after the World War have been directed toward the formation of states and the regulation of their frontiers according to a consciously national program.::Christian Lous Lange
Internationalism is a community theory of society which is founded on economic, spiritual, and biological facts. It maintains that respect for a healthy development of human society and of world civilization requires that mankind be organized internationally.::Christian Lous Lange
Internationalism on the other hand admits that spiritual achievements have their roots deep in national life from this national consciousness art and literature derive their character and strength and on it even many of the humanistic sciences are firmly based.::Christian Lous Lange
It is an accepted commonplace in psychology that the spiritual level of people acting as a crowd is far lower than the mean of each individual's intelligence or morality.::Christian Lous Lange
Propaganda must appeal to mankind's better judgment and to the necessary belief in a better future. For this belief, the valley of the shadow of death is but a war station on the road to the blessed summit.::Christian Lous Lange
Just as characteristic, perhaps, is the intellectual interdependence created through the development of the modern media of communication: post, telegraph, telephone, and popular press.::Christian Lous Lange
Obedience is the fruit of faith.::Christina Rossetti
She gave up beauty in her tender youth, gave all her hope and joy and pleasant ways she covered up her eyes lest they should gaze on vanity, and chose the bitter truth.::Christina Rossetti
Better by far you should forget and smile that you should remember and be sad.::Christina Rossetti
Love shall be our token love be yours and love be mine.::Christina Rossetti
Hope is like a harebell trembling from its birth.::Christina Rossetti
Once you understand this way, you will be able to make your room alive you will be able to design a house together with your family a garden for your children places where you can work beautiful terraces where you can sit and dream.::Christopher Alexander
The structure of life I have described in buildings - the structure which I believe to be objective - is deeply and inextricably connected with the human person, and with the innermost nature of human feeling.::Christopher Alexander
The buildings that I build very often have a dreamlike reality. I don't mean by that they have a fantasy quality at all, in fact quite the reverse. They contain in some degree the ingredients that give dreams their power... stuff that's very close to us.::Christopher Alexander
There is one timeless way of building. It is a thousand years old, and the same today as it has ever been.

What do you mean by faith? Is faith enough for Man? Should he be satisfied with faith alone? Is there no way of finding out the truth? Is the attitude of faith, of believing in something for which there can be no more than philosophic proof, the true mark of a Christian?::Clifford D. Simak
If mankind were to continue in other than the present barbarism, a new path must be found, a new civilization based on some other method than technology.::Clifford D. Simak
Without consciousness and intelligence, the universe would lack meaning.::Clifford D. Simak

I'm writing a review of three books on feminism and science, and it's about social constructionism. So I would say I'm a social constructionist, whatever that means.::Clifford Geertz
I think the perception of there being a deep gulf between science and the humanities is false.::Clifford Geertz
Gender consciousness has become involved in almost every intellectual field: history, literature, science, anthropology. There's been an extraordinary advance.::Clifford Geertz

The way in which mathematicians and physicists and historians talk is quite different, and what a physicist means by physical intuition and what a mathematician means by beauty or elegance are things worth thinking about.::Clifford Geertz
And I think it's that time. And I think if you just step aside and Mr. Romney can kind of take over. You can maybe still use a plane. Though maybe a smaller one. Not that big gas guzzler you are going around to colleges and talking about student loans and stuff like that.::Clint Eastwood
I was drafted during the Korean War.::Clint Eastwood
I haven't been very active in politics.::Clint Eastwood

I had three points I wanted to make: That not everybody in Hollywood is on the left, that Obama has broken a lot of the promises he made when he took office, and that the people should feel free to get rid of any politician who's not doing a good job. But I didn't make up my mind exactly what I was going to say until I said it.::Clint Eastwood
I think being able to age gracefully is a very important talent. It is too late for me.::Clint Eastwood
I just think it is important that you realize , that you're the best in the world. Whether you are a Democrat or Republican or whether you're libertarian or whatever, you are the best. And we should not ever forget that. And when somebody does not do the job, we got to let them go.::Clint Eastwood
Our modern society - especially in the West, and especially now - reveres youth.::Clint Eastwood
Crimes against children are the most heinous crime. That, for me, would be a reason for capital punishment because children are innocent and need the guidance of an adult society.::Clint Eastwood
Respect your efforts, respect yourself. Self-respect leads to self-discipline. When you have both firmly under your belt, that's real power.::Clint Eastwood
You know when you're young and you see a play in high school, and the guys all have gray in their hair and they're trying to be old men and they have no idea what that's like? It's just that stupid the other way around.::Clint Eastwood

Society is at odds with itself.::Clint Eastwood
It takes tremendous discipline to control the influence, the power you have over other people's lives.::Clint Eastwood
I still work out on a daily basis.::Clint Eastwood
My mother knew how to read music and everything. But I just kinda learned off of records. And so, I was listening to records and I'd play 'em over and over.::Clint Eastwood
People love westerns worldwide. There's something fantasy-like about an individual fighting the elements. Or even bad guys and the elements. It's a simpler time. There's no organized laws and stuff.::Clint Eastwood
Whether you like it or not, you're forced to come to the realisation that death is out there. But I don't fear death, I'm a fatalist. I believe when it's your time, that's it. It's the hand you're dealt.::Clint Eastwood
I keep working because I learn something new all the time.::Clint Eastwood
There are a lot of conservative people, a lot of moderate people, Republicans, Democrats, in Hollywood. It is just that the conservative people by the nature of the word itself play closer to the vest. They do not go around hot dogging it.::Clint Eastwood
Art and Religion are, then, two roads by which men escape from circumstance to ecstasy. Between aesthetic and religious rapture there is a family alliance. Art and Religion are means to similar states of mind.::Clive Bell
Genius worship is the inevitable sign of an uncreative age.::Clive Bell
A rose is the visible result of an infinitude of complicated goings on in the bosom of the earth and in the air above, and similarly a work of art is the product of strange activities in the human mind.::Clive Bell
Everyone has a right to a university degree in America, even if it's in Hamburger Technology.::Clive James
It is only when they go wrong that machines remind you how powerful they are.::Clive James
I realized that I would have some very tough sledding, and I was very discouraged because I didn't see much hope of getting into the field I wanted to get into with no college education.::Clyde Tombaugh
I think the driving thing was curiosity about the universe. That fascinated me. I didn't think anything about being famous or anything like that, I was just interested in the concepts involved.::Clyde Tombaugh
It was depressing, very depressing. I worried about how I would make a living. I didn't want to stay on the farm. It didn't offer the challenge I wanted and yet, without a college education, I felt that I was really out of luck.::Clyde Tombaugh
That's the way I got along in life. I don't ever remember being particularly jealous of anybody, because I figured if I can't do it myself, I don't deserve to get it.::Clyde Tombaugh
Can you imagine young people nowadays making a study of trigonometry for the fun of it? Well I did.::Clyde Tombaugh
A person that much interested in science is going to neglect his social life somewhat, but not completely, because that isn't healthy either. So one has to work it out according to one's own inclinations, how one wants to proportion these things.::Clyde Tombaugh
Unfortunately, a lot of the concepts in the Bible are based on ancient mythology that doesn't fit the findings of science.::Clyde Tombaugh
I have a lot of sympathy for young people because I realize how disturbed I was. How would I deal with life in the future? What would I do for a living?::Clyde Tombaugh
I think there's a supreme power behind the whole thing, an intelligence. Look at all of the instincts of nature, both animals and plants, the very ingenious ways they survive. If you cut yourself, you don't have to think about it.::Clyde Tombaugh

Gentleness doesn't get work done unless you happen to be a hen laying eggs.::Coco Chanel

Get mad, then get over it.::Colin Powell
My own experience is use the tools that are out there. Use the digital world. But never lose sight of the need to reach out and talk to other people who don't share your view. Listen to them and see if you can find a way to compromise.::Colin Powell

When you decide to get involved in a military operation in a place like Syria, you've got to be prepared, as we learned from Iraq and Afghanistan, to become the government, and I'm not sure any country, either the United States or I don't hear of anyone else, who's willing to take on that responsibility.::Colin Powell

You should see what our Founding Fathers used to say to each other and in the early part of our nation.

And they had to deal with slavery.::Colin Powell

Because people are very interested in my poetry, in what I say.::Compay Segundo

We are not merely passive pawns of historical forces nor are we victims of the past. We can shape and direct history.::Daisaku Ikeda

Now, I know you expected me to say that, well, I just kick back in the rocking chair, fished a little bit, listened to Willie Nelson tapes and watched old baseball games on the Classic Sports network. And, tell you the truth, I have done that for maybe about five total minutes.::Dan Rather
But we cannot rely on memorials and museums alone. We can tell ourselves we will never forget and we likely won't. But we need to make sure that we teach history to those who never had the opportunity to remember in the first place.::Dan Rather
A free and truly independent press - fiercely independent when necessary - is the red beating heart of freedom and democracy.::Dan Rather
A tough lesson in life that one has to learn is that not everybody wishes you well.::Dan Rather
I still love following and thinking about politics. I enjoy recommending important journalism I read or see from other sources.::Dan Rather
Don't taunt the alligator until after you've crossed the creek.::Dan Rather
I had just turned 10-years-old when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor and plunged America into World War II.::Dan Rather
I respect and empathize with reporters and editors who must compete in today's environment. And I know full well that when I've been covering campaigns, which I still do, I've made my mistakes and have been far from perfect.::Dan Rather
Performing doesn't turn me on. It's an egomaniac business, filled with prima donnas - including this one.::Dan Rather
As long as I have my health, I want to be reporting somewhere.::Dan Rather
Fear rules almost every newsroom in the country.::Dan Rather
I have witnessed how education opens doors, and I know that when sound instruction takes place, students experience the joys of new-found knowledge and the ability to excel.::Daniel Akaka
The intellectual takes as a starting point his self and relates the world to his own sensibilities the scientist accepts an existing field of knowledge and seeks to map out the unexplored terrain.::Daniel Bell
When theology erodes and organization crumbles, when the institutional framework of religion begins to break up, the search for a direct experience which people can feel to be religious facilitates the rise of cults.::Daniel Bell
Technology, like art, is a soaring exercise of the human imagination.::Daniel Bell
One is called to live nonviolently, even if the change one works for seems impossible.::Daniel Berrigan
It's also reflective of a young person's religion or faith in that it's highly charged with sacramental imagery and with country imagery, because I was in the seminary for so many years in the country.::Daniel Berrigan
We were then in a dangerous, helpless situation, exposed daily to perils and death amongst savages and wild beasts, not a white man in the country but ourselves.::Daniel Boone
May the same Almighty Goodness banish the accursed monster, war, from all lands, with her hated associates, rapine and insatiable ambition!::Daniel Boone
All you need for happiness is a good gun, a good horse, and a good wife.::Daniel Boone
Let peace, descending from her native heaven, bid her olives spring amidst the joyful nations and plenty, in league with commerce, scatter blessings from her copious hand!::Daniel Boone
In this situation I was constantly exposed to danger and death.::Daniel Boone
Make no little plans they have no magic to stir men's blood.::Daniel Burnham
Make big plans aim high in hope and work, remembering that a noble, logical diagram once recorded will not die.::Daniel Burnham
We must depend upon the Boy Scout Movement to produce the MEN of the future.::Daniel Carter Beard
He who stands with his face to the East in the morning will have the sun before him. If he does not change his posture, the Earth in the meantime having changed its, he will have the sun no longer before him, but behind.::Daniel De Leon
I have often thought of it as one of the most barbarous customs in the world, considering us as a civilized and a Christian country, that we deny the advantages of learning to women.::Daniel Defoe
There are two types of courage involved with what I did. When it comes to picking up a rifle, millions of people are capable of doing that, as we see in Iraq or Vietnam. But when it comes to risking their careers, or risking being invited to lunch by the establishment, it turns out that's remarkably rare.::Daniel Ellsberg
It was a good 15 or 20 years before anyone at Rand would be in the same room with me. They didn't want the question raised, 'What's your relationship with Daniel Ellsberg?' And not one of them wrote me a letter because they didn't want a letter of theirs to show up in my trash - which the FBI had been going through.::Daniel Ellsberg
The President's speech suggested to me that were we to follow his leadership, we will be in Iraq not for months, but for years. I also hope I am wrong on this.::Daniel Inouye
Mr. Gonzales' failure to respond to questions legitimately posed to him by the Senate raises grave doubts in my mind as to his fitness to serve the people of the United States as their Attorney General.::Daniel Inouye
I hope that the mistakes made and suffering imposed upon Japanese Americans nearly 60 years ago will not be repeated against Arab Americans whose loyalties are now being called into question.::Daniel Inouye
The greatest obstacle to discovery is not ignorance - it is the illusion of knowledge.::Daniel J. Boorstin
Education is learning what you didn't even know you didn't know.::Daniel J. Boorstin
As you make your bed, so you must lie in it.::Daniel J. Boorstin
An image is not simply a trademark, a design, a slogan or an easily remembered picture. It is a studiously crafted personality profile of an individual, institution, corporation, product or service.::Daniel J. Boorstin
Time makes heroes but dissolves celebrities.::Daniel J. Boorstin
A wonderful thing about a book, in contrast to a computer screen, is that you can take it to bed with you.::Daniel J. Boorstin
Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some hire public relations officers.::Daniel J. Boorstin
The most important American addition to the World Experience was the simple surprising fact of America. We have helped prepare mankind for all its later surprises.::Daniel J. Boorstin
Freedom means the opportunity to be what we never thought we would be.::Daniel J. Boorstin
The courage to imagine the otherwise is our greatest resource, adding color and suspense to all our life.::Daniel J. Boorstin
The force of the advertising word and image dwarfs the power of other literature in the 20th century.::Daniel J. Boorstin
Knowledge is not simply another commodity. On the contrary. Knowledge is never used up. It increases by diffusion and grows by dispersion.::Daniel J. Boorstin
Technology is so much fun but we can drown in our technology. The fog of information can drive out knowledge.::Daniel J. Boorstin
The traveler was active he went strenuously in search of people, of adventure, of experience. The tourist is passive he expects interesting things to happen to him. He goes 'sight-seeing.'::Daniel J. Boorstin
I did graduate with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering in 1948.::Daniel J. Evans
I think I finally chose the graduate degree in engineering primarily because it only took one year and law school took three years, and I felt the pressure of being a little behind - although I was just 22.::Daniel J. Evans
Experienced happiness refers to your feelings, to how happy you are as you live your life. In contrast, the satisfaction of the remembering self refers to your feelings when you think about your life.::Daniel Kahneman
When you analyze happiness, it turns out that the way you spend your time is extremely important.::Daniel Kahneman
I believe in one God, the first and great cause of goodness. I also believe in Jesus Christ, the rebirth of the world. I also believe in the Holy Ghost, the comforter.::Daniel Morgan
As to war, I am and always was a great enemy, at the same time a warrior the greater part of my life and were I young again, should still be a warrior while ever this country should be invaded and I lived.::Daniel Morgan
Where you have no religion, you are sure to have no government, for as religion disappears, anarchy takes place and fixes a compleat Hell on earth till religion returns.::Daniel Morgan
And of course, identifying all human genes and proteins will have great medical significance.::Daniel Nathans
The glimpses of human strength and frailty that a physician sees are with me still.::Daniel Nathans
So I applied to medical school and received a scholarship at Washington University in St. Louis. Washington University turned out to be a lucky choice. The faculty was scholarly and dedicated and accessible to students.::Daniel Nathans
Somehow liberals have been unable to acquire from life what conservatives seem to be endowed with at birth: namely, a healthy skepticism of the powers of government agencies to do good.::Daniel Patrick Moynihan
The great corporations of this country were not founded by ordinary people. They were founded by people with extraordinary intelligence, ambition, and aggressiveness.::Daniel Patrick Moynihan
The central conservative truth is that it is culture, not politics, that determines the success of a society. The central liberal truth is that politics can change a culture and save it from itself.::Daniel Patrick Moynihan
The steady expansion of welfare programs can be taken as a measure of the steady disintegration of the Negro family structure over the past generation in the United States.::Daniel Patrick Moynihan
There has been a change in attitude, though.::Daniel Petrie
On the diffusion of education among the people rest the preservation and perpetuation of our free institutions.::Daniel Webster
The world is governed more by appearance than realities so that it is fully as necessary to seem to know something as to know it.::Daniel Webster
The contest for ages has been to rescue liberty from the grasp of executive power.::Daniel Webster
Wisdom begins at the end.::Daniel Webster
An unlimited power to tax involves, necessarily, the power to destroy.::Daniel Webster
Whatever makes men good Christians, makes them good citizens.::Daniel Webster
There is nothing so powerful as truth, and often nothing so strange.::Daniel Webster
Whatever government is not a government of laws, is a despotism, let it be called what it may.::Daniel Webster
Justice, sir, is the great interest of man on earth. It is the ligament which holds civilized beings and civilized nations together.::Daniel Webster
Failure is more frequently from want of energy than want of capital.::Daniel Webster
Keep cool anger is not an argument.::Daniel Webster
The people's government, made for the people, made by the people, and answerable to the people.::Daniel Webster
Look, people have an image of Italians. When I go somewhere in the world, I don't care where it is, when they look at me it's not about my intelligence. It's who can I beat up.::Danny Aiello
There was certainly less profanity in the Godfather than in the Sopranos. There was a kind of respect. It's not that I totally agreed with it, but it was a great piece of art.::Danny Aiello
Death can't be so bad if mom went through it. It makes it easier for the child to follow.::Danny Aiello
People have an image of Italians. When I go somewhere in the world, I don't care where it is, when they look at me it's not about my intelligence. It's who can I beat up.::Danny Aiello
I wasn't born a fool. It took work to get this way.::Danny Kaye
To travel is to take a journey into yourself.::Danny Kaye
Life is a great big canvas throw all the paint you can at it.::Danny Kaye
All of us are born for a reason, but all of us don't discover why. Success in life has nothing to do with what you gain in life or accomplish for yourself. It's what you do for others.::Danny Thomas

The sad souls of those who lived without blame and without praise.::Dante Alighieri
Nature is the art of God.::Dante Alighieri
The customs and fashions of men change like leaves on the bough, some of which go and others come.::Dante Alighieri
Art, as far as it is able, follows nature, as a pupil imitates his master thus your art must be, as it were, God's grandchild.::Dante Alighieri
Be as a tower firmly set Shakes not its top for any blast that blows.::Dante Alighieri
Beauty awakens the soul to act.::Dante Alighieri
All hope abandon, ye who enter here!::Dante Alighieri
Heat cannot be separated from fire, or beauty from The Eternal.::Dante Alighieri
Pride, envy, avarice - these are the sparks have set on fire the hearts of all men.::Dante Alighieri
Consider your origins: you were not made to live as brutes, but to follow virtue and knowledge.::Dante Alighieri
The secret of getting things done is to act!::Dante Alighieri
The darkest places in hell are reserved for those who maintain their neutrality in times of moral crisis.::Dante Alighieri
There is no greater sorrow than to recall happiness in times of misery.::Dante Alighieri
The worst moment for the atheist is when he is really thankful and has nobody to thank.::Dante Gabriel Rossetti
Happiness is not a possession to be prized, it is a quality of thought, a state of mind.::Daphne du Maurier

Know how to live the time that is given you.::Dario Fo
Every artistic expression is either influenced by or adds something to politics.::Dario Fo
I know that the odds are against a marriage lasting 60 years.::Darrell Royal
I have found that the players who have played in that game really do have respect for their adversaries.::Darrell Royal
I don't count on the boy who waits till October, when it's cool and fun, then decides he wants to play.::Darrell Royal
I'm still healthy as can be.::Darrell Royal
For me, it is just the total experience - from the time I first started as an assistant coach until I wound up at the University of Texas for 20 years.::Darrell Royal
I never have planned a whole lot of future. It's one day at a time.::Darrell Royal
You know, a football coach is nothing more than a teacher. You teach them the same subject, and you have a group of new guys every year.::Darrell Royal
They have the ability to take a person's freedom from them. On certain situations, they have the ability to take a person's reputation. And under certain circumstances, they have the authority to take a person's life.::Daryl Gates
I'm always hoping for the nights that are inspired where you almost have an out of body experience.::Dave Brubeck
Jazz stands for freedom. It's supposed to be the voice of freedom: Get out there and improvise, and take chances, and don't be a perfectionist - leave that to the classical musicians.::Dave Brubeck
Jazz is about freedom within discipline. Usually a dictatorship like in Russia and Germany will prevent jazz from being played because it just seemed to represent freedom, democracy and the United States.::Dave Brubeck
My dad was the manager at the 45,000-acre ranch, but he owned his own 1,200-acre ranch, and I owned four cattle that he gave to me when I graduated from grammar school, from the eighth grade. And those cows multiplied, and he kept track of them for years for me. And that was my herd.::Dave Brubeck
I played a lot of sports and it's the plays in basketball that weren't worked out that are the ones that are just fantastic that you remember. We don't know the power that's within our own bodies.::Dave Brubeck
That's the beauty of music. You can take a theme from a Bach sacred chorale and improvise. It doesn't make any difference where the theme comes from the treatment of it can be jazz.::Dave Brubeck
Many people don't understand how disciplined you have to be to play jazz... And that is really the idea of democracy - freedom within the Constitution or discipline. You don't just get out there and do anything you want.::Dave Brubeck
I got a poster from Columbia Records, and there's Miles Davis, Charlie Mingus, Ellington, Count Basie - everybody in that poster has died, I'm the only one left. And great players like Paul Desmond and Gerry Mulligan, it's hard to believe they're gone because we were all so close. But I believe in the future and the tradition will go on.::Dave Brubeck
I'm beginning to understand myself. But it would have been great to be able to understand myself when I was 20 rather than when I was 82.::Dave Brubeck
Experience taught me that working families are often just one pay check away from economic disaster. And it showed me first-hand the importance of every family having access to good health care.::Dave Obey
Honesty is the cruelest game of all, because not only can you hurt someone - and hurt them to the bone - you can feel self-righteous about it at the same time.::Dave Van Ronk
Most of what I listen to now is mainstream jazz from 1935 right up to and including early bebop and cool jazz.::Dave Van Ronk
You can't be afraid of failure and you can't be afraid of success, because either one gets in the way of your work.::Dave Van Ronk
It is not the beauty of a building you should look at its the construction of the foundation that will stand the test of time.::David Allan Coe
I've never wanted anybody to like me because I had long hair or short hair, or that they liked the way I dressed or they liked the way I dressed or they liked the way I smile.::David Allan Coe
Freedom cannot be given... It can only be taken away.::David Allan Coe
All men are created equal, it is only men themselves who place themselves above equality.::David Allan Coe
Lawrence Ferlinghetti had a tremendous education as an artist and also an enormous knowledge of literarture.::David Amram
We had common interests in the beauty of the French language. We both had a tremendous love of jazz. We shared dreams of getting married and having a family, living in the country, leading an idyllic life.::David Amram
Allen Ginsberg was a world authority on the writing of William Blake, and had an incredible knowledge of classic literature and world politics.::David Amram
That is what I did with Jack, and that's why he liked to do the readings with me because he knew I was there for him, and for our ability to blend the poetry and the music.::David Amram
I hardly remember how I started to write poetry. It's hard to imagine what I thought poetry could do.::David Antin
While I've had a great distaste for what's usually called song in modern poetry or for what's usually called music, I really don't think of speech as so far from song.::David Antin
When you grow up in a family of languages, you develop a kind of casual fluency, so that languages, though differently colored, all seem transparent to experience.::David Antin
The self is an oral society in which the present is constantly running a dialogue with the past and the future inside of one skin.::David Antin
All we can hope for is that the thing is going to slowly and imperceptibly shift. All I can say is that 50 years ago there were no such thing as environmental policies.::David Attenborough
Nature isn't positive in that way. It doesn't aim itself at you. It's not being unkind to you.::David Attenborough
It seems to me that the natural world is the greatest source of excitement the greatest source of visual beauty the greatest source of intellectual interest. It is the greatest source of so much in life that makes life worth living.::David Attenborough
The whole of science, and one is tempted to think the whole of the life of any thinking man, is trying to come to terms with the relationship between yourself and the natural world. Why are you here, and how do you fit in, and what's it all about.::David Attenborough
It's coming home to roost over the next 50 years or so. It's not just climate change it's sheer space, places to grow food for this enormous horde. Either we limit our population growth or the natural world will do it for us, and the natural world is doing it for us right now.::David Attenborough
I can mention many moments that were unforgettable and revelatory. But the most single revelatory three minutes was the first time I put on scuba gear and dived on a coral reef. It's just the unbelievable fact that you can move in three dimensions.::David Attenborough
Steve Irwin did wonderful conservation work but I was uncomfortable about some of his stunts. Even if animals aren't aware that you are not treating them with respect, the viewers are.::David Attenborough
I'm not in politics.::David Attenborough
You can cry about death and very properly so, your own as well as anybody else's. But it's inevitable, so you'd better grapple with it and cope and be aware that not only is it inevitable, but it has always been inevitable, if you see what I mean.::David Attenborough
The climate, the economic situation, rising birth rates none of these things give me a lot of hope or reason to be optimistic.::David Attenborough
You can only get really unpopular decisions through if the electorate is convinced of the value of the environment. That's what natural history programmes should be for.::David Attenborough
I think a major element of jetlag is psychological. Nobody ever tells me what time it is at home.::David Attenborough
In the old days... it was a basic, cardinal fact that producers didn't have opinions. When I was producing natural history programmes, I didn't use them as vehicles for my own opinion. They were factual programmes.::David Attenborough
There is no question that climate change is happening the only arguable point is what part humans are playing in it.::David Attenborough
People talk about doom-laden scenarios happening in the future: they are happening in Africa now. You can see it perfectly clearly. Periodic famines are due to too many people living on land that can't sustain them.::David Attenborough
Before the BBC, I joined the Navy in order to travel.::David Attenborough
I had a huge advantage when I started 50 years ago - my job was secure. I didn't have to promote myself. These days there's far more pressure to make a mark, so the temptation is to make adventure television or personality shows. I hope the more didactic approach won't be lost.::David Attenborough
Dealing with global warming doesn't mean we have all got to suddenly stop breathing. Dealing with global warming means that we have to stop waste, and if you travel for no reason whatsoever, that is a waste.::David Attenborough
I don't run a car, have never run a car. I could say that this is because I have this extremely tender environmentalist conscience, but the fact is I hate driving.::David Attenborough
People must feel that the natural world is important and valuable and beautiful and wonderful and an amazement and a pleasure.::David Attenborough
I like animals. I like natural history. The travel bit is not the important bit. The travel bit is what you have to do in order to go and look at animals.::David Attenborough
Many individuals are doing what they can. But real success can only come if there is a change in our societies and in our economics and in our politics.::David Attenborough
Cameramen are among the most extraordinarily able and competent people I know. They have to have an insight into natural history that gives them a sixth sense of what the creature is going to do, so they can be ready to follow.::David Attenborough
I often get letters, quite frequently, from people who say how they like the programmes a lot, but I never give credit to the almighty power that created nature.::David Attenborough
The process of making natural history films is to try to prevent the animal knowing you are there, so you get glimpses of a non-human world, and that is a transporting thing.::David Attenborough
If I were beginning my career today, I don't think I would take the same direction. Television is at a crossroads at the moment. And although I am not up to date technologically, I suspect that somewhere out there people are conveying things about natural history by means other than television, and I think if I were beginning today, I'd be there.::David Attenborough
Natural history is not about producing fables.::David Attenborough
Television of course actually started in Britain in 1936, and it was a monopoly, and there was only one broadcaster and it operated on a license which is not the same as a government grant.::David Attenborough
The skull is nature's sculpture.::David Bailey
When I stop working, I go out and start working again. Most people paint a picture, or whatever they do, and go home. For me, it has to be continuous.::David Bailey
In New York, everyone's desperate for success, desperate for money and desperate to be accepted, but in London they're more laid back about things like that.::David Bailey
I was surrounded by strong women so it had never even occurred to me that women were anything other than equal to men.::David Bailey
Fashion often starts off beautiful and becomes ugly, whereas art starts off ugly sometimes and becomes beautiful.::David Bailey
I love learning new techniques.::David Bailey
To get rich, you have to be making money while you're asleep.::David Bailey
It is a sign of a dull nature to occupy oneself deeply in matters that concern the body for instance, to be over much occupied about exercise, about eating and drinking, about easing oneself, about sexual intercourse.::David Bailey
If you're curious, London's an amazing place.::David Bailey
I like change. There's something Buddhist about it - continuous change is wonderful.::David Bailey
London changes because of money. It's real estate. If they can build some offices or expensive apartments they will, it's money that changes everything in a city.::David Bailey
It takes a lot of imagination to be a good photographer. You need less imagination to be a painter because you can invent things. But in photography everything is so ordinary it takes a lot of looking before you learn to see the extraordinary.::David Bailey
I didn't know a time when there wasn't a war because I spent all my time from the age of two or three to eight in a coal cellar really.::David Bailey
A positive attitude can really make dreams come true - it did for me.::David Bailey
All pictures are unnatural. All pictures are sad because they're about dead people. Paintings you don't think of in a special time or with a specific event. With photos I always think I'm looking at something dead.::David Bailey
Photography is more about money now but then so are most things.::David Bailey
The trouble with people like Tony Blair is they get confused, they think intelligence is education when they're two different things.::David Bailey
I left school on my 15th birthday.::David Bailey
The best advice I ever got was that knowledge is power and to keep reading.::David Bailey
I'm not mad about movies, there are too many people involved in the making of them, and they lack a definitive creative focus.::David Bailey
I think we can allow the therapeutic uses of nuclear transplant technology, which we call cloning, without running the danger of actually having live human beings born.::David Baltimore
Ours is a country built more on people than on territory. The Jews will come from everywhere: from France, from Russia, from America, from Yemen... Their faith is their passport.::David Ben-Gurion
Courage is a special kind of knowledge: the knowledge of how to fear what ought to be feared and how not to fear what ought not to be feared.::David Ben-Gurion
Courage is... the knowledge of how to fear what ought to be feared and how not to fear what ought not to be feared.::David Ben-Gurion
So one begins to wonder what is going to happen to the human race. Technology keeps on advancing with greater and greater power, either for good or for destruction.::David Bohm
Then there is the further question of what is the relationship of thinking to reality. As careful attention shows, thought itself is in an actual process of movement.::David Bohm
The ability to perceive or think differently is more important than the knowledge gained.::David Bohm
Yet it looks as if the thing we use to solve our problems with is the source of our problems. It's like going to the doctor and having him make you ill. In fact, in 20% of medical cases we do apparently have that going on. But in the case of thought, its far over 20%.::David Bohm
Similarly, thought is a system. That system not only includes thought and feelings, but it includes the state of the body it includes the whole of society - as thought is passing back and forth between people in a process by which thought evolved from ancient times.::David Bohm
During the past few decades, modern technology, with radio, TV, air travel, and satellites, has woven a network of communication which puts each part of the world in to almost instant contact with all the other parts.::David Bohm
Yet, in spite of this world-wide system of linkages, there is, at this very moment, a general feeling that communication is breaking down everywhere, on an unparalleled scale.::David Bohm
I have a secret thought from some things I have observed, that God may perhaps design you for some singular service in the world.::David Brainerd
We should always look upon ourselves as God's servants, placed in God's world, to do his work and accordingly labour faithfully for him not with a design to grow rich and great, but to glorify God, and do all the good we possibly can.::David Brainerd
The all-seeing eye of God beheld our deplorable state infinite pity touched the heart of the Father of mercies and infinite wisdom laid the plan of our recovery.::David Brainerd
I fear God never showed mercy to one so vile as I.::David Brainerd
As the most extravagant errors were received among the established articles of their faith, so the most infamous vices obtained in their practice, and were indulged not only with impunity, but authorized by the sanction of their laws.::David Brainerd
I bless God for this retirement: I never was more thankful for any thing than I have been of late for the necessity I am under of self-denial in many respects.::David Brainerd
Ardent love or desire introduced, as passionately longing to please and glorify the Divine Being, to be in every respect conformed to him, and in that way to enjoy him.::David Brainerd
Further, Take heed that you faithfully perform the business you have to do in the world, from a regard to the commands of God and not from an ambitious desire of being esteemed better than others.::David Brainerd
Once more, Never think that you can live to God by your own power or strength but always look to and rely on him for assistance, yea, for all strength and grace.::David Brainerd
We are a long time in learning that all our strength and salvation is in God.::David Brainerd
If you hope for happiness in the world, hope for it from God, and not from the world.::David Brainerd
A vegetarian is a person who won't eat anything that can have children.::David Brenner
When I go to a bar, I don't go looking for a girl who knows the capital of Maine.::David Brenner
A successful man is one who can lay a firm foundation with the bricks others have thrown at him.::David Brinkley
This is the first convention of the space age - where a candidate can promise the moon and mean it.::David Brinkley
Numerous politicians have seized absolute power and muzzled the press. Never in history has the press seized absolute power and muzzled the politicians.::David Brinkley
You know, I've never actually really believed that death is inevitable. I just think it's a rumor.::David Carradine
Why would you be afraid of death? It would be an inconvenience. I have a lot of undone things and it's bound to get in the way. But, no, it doesn't scare me at all.::David Carradine
Quentin is very organic there was no way that he was going to put someone else's hand in there and anyway, my hands are kind of famous. It seemed right.::David Carradine
If you cannot be a poet, be the poem.::David Carradine
Quentin and I were constantly finding something new that we had in common and comic books were one of them. I think we were talking about comic books much earlier in our relationship, before I had the part.::David Carradine
Children are amazing, and while I go to places like Princeton and Harvard and Yale, and of course I teach at Columbia, NYU, and that's nice and I love students, but the most fun of all are the real little ones, the young ones.::David Dinkins
The art and culture that is New York, communications, finance, all these things help make up New York. The rest of the country should be happy that we are what we are.::David Dinkins
I hesitate to predict whether this theory is true. But if the general opinion of Mankind is optimistic then we're in for a period of extreme popularity for science fiction.::David Eddings
I taught in a small teacher's college for three or four years, at which point all the administrators got a pay raise and the teaching faculty didn't.::David Eddings
I wrote a novel for my degree, and I'm very happy I didn't submit that to a publisher. I sympathize with my professors who had to read it.::David Eddings
I get up at an unholy hour in the morning my work day is completed by the time the sun rises. I have a slightly bad back which has made an enormous contribution to American literature.::David Eddings
The unfortunate thing about working for yourself is that you have the worst boss in the world. I work every day of the year except at Christmas, when I work a half day.::David Eddings
Friendships in childhood are usually a matter of chance, whereas in adolescence they are most often a matter of choice.::David Elkind
Over the last half century the television interview has given us some of TV's most heart-stopping and memorable moments. On the surface it is a simple format - two people sitting across from one another having a conversation. But underneath it is often a power struggle - a battle for the psychological advantage.::David Frost
Love is staying up all night with a sick child - or a healthy adult.::David Frost
Diplomacy, n. is the art of letting somebody else have your way.::David Frost
Don't aim for success if you want it just do what you love and believe in, and it will come naturally.::David Frost
Television is an invention that permits you to be entertained in your living room by people you wouldn't have in your home.::David Frost
You are indebted to you imagination for three-fourths of your importance.::David Garrick
It's human nature to start taking things for granted again when danger isn't banging loudly on the door.::David Hackworth
But I have tried to go over it very carefully, not merely what the evidence is, but with psychoanalysts and psychologists, and I think we're just about all agreed that Lincoln and Speed did not have a homosexual relationship.::David Herbert Donald
The more I have studied Lincoln, the more I have followed his thought processes, the more I am convinced that he understood leadership better than any other American president.::David Herbert Donald
In Lincoln's day a President's religion was a very private affair. There were no public prayer meetings, no attempts to woo the Religious Right. Few of Lincoln's countrymen knew anything at all of his religious beliefs.::David Herbert Donald
Galileo was no idiot. Only an idiot could believe that science requires martyrdom - that may be necessary in religion, but in time a scientific result will establish itself.::David Hilbert
Mathematical science is in my opinion an indivisible whole, an organism whose vitality is conditioned upon the connection of its parts.::David Hilbert
If one were to bring ten of the wisest men in the world together and ask them what was the most stupid thing in existence, they would not be able to discover anything so stupid as astrology.::David Hilbert
The further a mathematical theory is developed, the more harmoniously and uniformly does its construction proceed, and unsuspected relations are disclosed between hitherto separated branches of the science.::David Hilbert
How thoroughly it is ingrained in mathematical science that every real advance goes hand in hand with the invention of sharper tools and simpler methods which, at the same time, assist in understanding earlier theories and in casting aside some more complicated developments.::David Hilbert
You had to be aware that I saw that photography was a mere episode in the history of the optical projection and when the chemicals ended, meaning the picture was fixed by chemicals, we were in a new era.::David Hockney
I'm a very early riser, and I don't like to miss that beautiful early morning light.::David Hockney

I did come from a pretty independent-minded family.::David Hockney
I was always struck by how Picasso had no interest in music.::David Hockney
The moment you cheat for the sake of beauty, you know you're an artist.::David Hockney
Shadows sometimes people don't see shadows. The Chinese of course never paint them in pictures, oriental art never deals with shadow. But I noticed these shadows and I knew it meant it was sunny.::David Hockney
I draw flowers every day and send them to my friends so they get fresh blooms every morning.::David Hockney
Art has to move you and design does not, unless it's a good design for a bus.::David Hockney
I think my father would have liked to have been an artist, actually. But I think he didn't quite have perhaps the drive or, I don't know, I mean he had a family to bring up I suppose.::David Hockney
Cubism was an attack on the perspective that had been known and used for 500 years. It was the first big, big change. It confused people: they said, 'Things don't look like that!'::David Hockney
I went to art school actually when I was sixteen years old.::David Hockney
People criticized me for my photography. They said it's not art.::David Hockney
Well you can't teach the poetry, but you can teach the craft.::David Hockney
To me, the world's rather beautiful if you look at it. Especially nature.::David Hockney
Listening is a positive act: you have to put yourself out to do it.::David Hockney
Anyway I feel myself a bit on the edge on the art world, but I don't mind, I'm just pursuing my work in a very excited way. And there isn't really a mainstream anymore, is there?::David Hockney
I go and see anything that's visually new, any technology that's about picture-making. The technology won't make the pictures different, but someone using it will.::David Hockney
We live in an age where the artist is forgotten. He is a researcher. I see myself that way.::David Hockney
What an artist is trying to do for people is bring them closer to something, because of course art is about sharing. You wouldn't be an artist unless you wanted to share an experience, a thought.::David Hockney
As a result of America's efforts to realize the ideals of equality and freedom, blacks in America are now the freest and richest black people anywhere on the face of the earth including all of the nations that are ruled by blacks.::David Horowitz
We can trust our doctors to be professional, to minister equally to their patients without regard to their political or religious beliefs. But we can no longer trust our professors to do the same.::David Horowitz
If we celebrate Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday at a time of presidential inaugurals, this is thanks to Ronald Reagan who created the holiday, and not to the Democratic Congress of the Carter years, which rejected it.::David Horowitz
A university is not a political party, and an education is not an indoctrination.::David Horowitz
Belief is nothing but a more vivid, lively, forcible, firm, steady conception of an object, than what the imagination alone is ever able to attain.::David Hume
Scholastic learning and polemical divinity retarded the growth of all true knowledge.::David Hume
There is not to be found, in all history, any miracle attested by a sufficient number of men, of such unquestioned good sense, education and learning, as to secure us against all delusion in themselves.::David Hume
Nothing endears so much a friend as sorrow for his death. The pleasure of his company has not so powerful an influence.::David Hume
There is a very remarkable inclination in human nature to bestow on external objects the same emotions which it observes in itself, and to find every where those ideas which are most present to it.::David Hume
A man acquainted with history may, in some respect, be said to have lived from the beginning of the world, and to have been making continual additions to his stock of knowledge in every century.::David Hume
Beauty, whether moral or natural, is felt, more properly than perceived.::David Hume
Heaven and hell suppose two distinct species of men, the good and the bad. But the greatest part of mankind float betwixt vice and virtue.::David Hume
Philosophy would render us entirely Pyrrhonian, were not nature too strong for it.::David Hume
Any person seasoned with a just sense of the imperfections of natural reason, will fly to revealed truth with the greatest avidity.::David Hume

The corruption of the best things gives rise to the worst.::David Hume
The Christian religion not only was at first attended with miracles, but even at this day cannot be believed by any reasonable person without one.::David Hume
A propensity to hope and joy is real riches one to fear and sorrow real poverty.::David Hume
This avidity alone, of acquiring goods and possessions for ourselves and our nearest friends, is insatiable, perpetual, universal, and directly destructive of society.::David Hume
A purpose, an intention, a design, strikes everywhere even the careless, the most stupid thinker.::David Hume
Truth springs from argument amongst friends.::David Hume
Every wise, just, and mild government, by rendering the condition of its subjects easy and secure, will always abound most in people, as well as in commodities and riches.::David Hume
The law always limits every power it gives.::David Hume
Generally speaking, the errors in religion are dangerous those in philosophy only ridiculous.::David Hume
The advantages found in history seem to be of three kinds, as it amuses the fancy, as it improves the understanding, and as it strengthens virtue.::David Hume
Men often act knowingly against their interest.::David Hume
Accuracy is, in every case, advantageous to beauty, and just reasoning to delicate sentiment. In vain would we exalt the one by depreciating the other.::David Hume
Beauty in things exists in the mind which contemplates them.::David Hume
The heights of popularity and patriotism are still the beaten road to power and tyranny.::David Hume
As long as you have a system that is based on the rational that if you are making money you are thereby making a contribution to society, these financial rogue practices will continue.::David Korten
Europeans say they are proud of their social fabric, of strong rights for workers and the weak in society.::David Korten
It will take some time before a politician will capture the imagination of the American people and have the vision and understanding to do what is necessary for a better future for the people of America and the world.::David Korten

All that I am I owe to Jesus Christ, revealed to me in His divine Book.::David Livingstone

History is a guide to navigation in perilous times. History is who we are and why we are the way we are.::David McCullough
Only to the extent that men desire peace and brotherhood can the world be made better. No peace even though temporarily obtained, will be permanent, whether to individuals or nations, unless it is built upon the solid foundation of eternal principles.::David O. McKay
Happiness and peace will come to earth only as the light of love and human compassion enter the souls of men.::David O. McKay
Let us realize that: the privilege to work is a gift, the power to work is a blessing, the love of work is success!::David O. McKay

I can't get my head around the fact that the technology of the first two movies, which are forty years prior to Star Wars, is so much better than any technology they had in Star Wars!::David Prowse
There can be no rise in the value of labour without a fall of profits.::David Ricardo
After all the fertile land in the immediate neighbourhood of the first settlers were cultivated, if capital and population increased, more food would be required, and it could only be procured from land not so advantageously situated.::David Ricardo
The facility of obtaining food is beneficial in two ways to the owners of capital, it at the same time raises profits and increases the amount of consumable commodities.::David Ricardo
Gold and silver, like other commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity, the quantity of labour bestowed in procuring them, and the value of the capital employed in the mines which produce them.::David Ricardo
By far the greatest part of those goods which are the objects of desire, are procured by labour and they may be multiplied, not in one country alone, but in many, almost without any assignable limit, if we are disposed to bestow the labour necessary to obtain them.::David Ricardo
The idea that men are created free and equal is both true and misleading: men are created different they lose their social freedom and their individual autonomy in seeking to become like each other.::David Riesman
For the greater beauty of the instrument, the balls representing the planets are to be of considerable bigness but so contrived, that they may be taken off at pleasure, and others, much smaller, and fitter for some purposes, put in their places.::David Rittenhouse
I owe much to mother. She had an expert's understanding, but also approached art emotionally.::David Rockefeller
I am convinced that material things can contribute a lot to making one's life pleasant, but, basically, if you do not have very good friends and relatives who matter to you, life will be really empty and sad and material things cease to be important.::David Rockefeller
I think of art as the highest level of creativity. To me, it is one of the greatest sources of enjoyment.::David Rockefeller
As children we recognized that we belonged to an unusual, even exceptional, family, but the effect was different on each of us.::David Rockefeller
Philanthropy is involved with basic innovations that transform society, not simply maintaining the status quo or filling basic social needs that were formerly the province of the public sector.::David Rockefeller
I learned more from my mother than from all the art historians and curators who have informed me about technical aspects of art history and art appreciation over the years.::David Rockefeller
I am a passionate traveler, and from the time I was a child, travel formed me as much as my formal education.::David Rockefeller
I believe that government is the servant of the people and not their master.::David Rockefeller
I hope the Guggenheim plan will be revived.::David Rockefeller
The Japanese have a wonderful sense of design and a refinement in their art. They try to produce beautiful paintings with the minimum number of strokes.::David Rockefeller
My grandfather, along with Carnegie, was a pioneer in philanthropy, which my father then practiced on a very large scale.::David Rockefeller
We cannot banish dangers, but we can banish fears. We must not demean life by standing in awe of death.::David Sarnoff
Work and live to serve others, to leave the world a little better than you found it and garner for yourself as much peace of mind as you can. This is happiness.::David Sarnoff
I have learned to have more faith in the scientist than he does in himself.::David Sarnoff
The will to persevere is often the difference between failure and success.::David Sarnoff

Wisdom is knowing what to do next virtue is doing it.::David Starr Jordan
The essence of true friendship is to make allowance for another's little lapses.::David Storey
For the sake of our health, our children and grandchildren and even our economic well-being, we must make protecting the planet our top priority.::David Suzuki
If we pollute the air, water and soil that keep us alive and well, and destroy the biodiversity that allows natural systems to function, no amount of money will save us.::David Suzuki
From year to year, environmental changes are incremental and often barely register in our lives, but from evolutionary or geological perspectives, what is happening is explosive change.::David Suzuki
Treaties, agreements and organizations to help settle disputes may be necessary, but they often favor the interests of business over citizens.::David Suzuki
We're in a giant car heading towards a brick wall and everyone's arguing over where they're going to sit.::David Suzuki
Outright bans on plastic bags may not be the best solution, but education and incentives to get people to stop using them are necessary.::David Suzuki
If America wants to retain its position as a global power, its president must listen to the people and show strong leadership at this turning point in human history.::David Suzuki
If we have any hope of finding ways for seven billion people to live well on planet with finite resources, we have to learn to use our resources efficiently. Plastic bags are neither efficient nor environmentally friendly.::David Suzuki
With the world's human population now at seven billion and growing, and the demand for technology and modern conveniences increasing, we can't control all our negative impacts. But we have to find better ways to live within the limits nature and its cycles impose.::David Suzuki
Thanks to evolution, our bodies have powerful ways to ward off illness and infection and enable us to live long and healthy lives. Why, then, do health costs continue to climb at unsustainable and frightening rates?::David Suzuki
The government's desire to expand global trade may be understandable, but we mustn't give away too much. We must tell our elected representatives to at least delay the Canada-China FIPA until it has been examined more thoroughly, and to reconsider the inclusion of investor-state arbitration mechanisms in all trade deals.::David Suzuki
As parents, grandparents, uncles and aunts we need to start getting out into nature with the young people in our lives. Families play a key role in getting kids outside.::David Suzuki
Most North Americans know that human-caused global warming is real, even if political leaders don't always reflect or act on that knowledge.::David Suzuki
Beyond reducing individual use, one of our top priorities must be to move from fossil fuels to energy that has fewer detrimental effects on water supplies and fewer environmental impacts overall.::David Suzuki
We must pay greater attention to keeping our bodies and minds healthy and able to heal. Yet we are making it difficult for our defences to work. We allow things to be sold that should not be called food. Many have no nutritive value and lead to obesity, salt imbalance, and allergies.::David Suzuki
Hydraulic fracturing requires massive amounts of water. Disposing of the toxic wastewater, as well as accidental spills, can contaminate drinking water and harm human health.::David Suzuki
Doing all we can to combat climate change comes with numerous benefits, from reducing pollution and associated health care costs to strengthening and diversifying the economy by shifting to renewable energy, among other measures.::David Suzuki
The failure of world leaders to act on the critical issue of global warming is often blamed on economic considerations.::David Suzuki
If we want to address global warming, along with the other environmental problems associated with our continued rush to burn our precious fossil fuels as quickly as possible, we must learn to use our resources more wisely, kick our addiction, and quickly start turning to sources of energy that have fewer negative impacts.::David Suzuki
The medical literature tells us that the most effective ways to reduce the risk of heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer's, and many more problems are through healthy diet and exercise. Our bodies have evolved to move, yet we now use the energy in oil instead of muscles to do our work.::David Suzuki
The damage that climate change is causing and that will get worse if we fail to act goes beyond the hundreds of thousands of lives, homes and businesses lost, ecosystems destroyed, species driven to extinction, infrastructure smashed and people inconvenienced.::David Suzuki
Global trade has advantages. For starters, it allows those of us who live through winter to eat fresh produce year-round. And it provides economic benefits to farmers who grow that food.::David Suzuki
The human brain now holds the key to our future. We have to recall the image of the planet from outer space: a single entity in which air, water, and continents are interconnected. That is our home.::David Suzuki
We can't blame children for occupying themselves with Facebook rather than playing in the mud. Our society doesn't put a priority on connecting with nature. In fact, too often we tell them it's dirty and dangerous.::David Suzuki
Conserving energy and thus saving money, reducing consumption of unnecessary products and packaging and shifting to a clean-energy economy would likely hurt the bottom line of polluting industries, but would undoubtedly have positive effects for most of us.::David Suzuki
Education has failed in a very serious way to convey the most important lesson science can teach: skepticism.::David Suzuki
In the environmental movement, every time you lose a battle it's for good, but our victories always seem to be temporary and we keep fighting them over and over again.::David Suzuki
We must reinvent a future free of blinders so that we can choose from real options.::David Suzuki
To love and be loved is to feel the sun from both sides.::David Viscott
The only thing that stands between a man and what he wants from life is often merely the will to try it and the faith to believe that it is possible.::David Viscott
If you could get up the courage to begin, you have the courage to succeed.::David Viscott
Our ministry is supported entirely by faith, through the missions gifts of readers who receive my messages every three weeks. We seldom mention money, and we never burden supporters.::David Wilkerson
Love is not only something you feel, it is something you do.::David Wilkerson
Riches and the things that are necessary in life are not evil in themselves. And all of us face cares and troubles in this life. The sin comes in the time and energy we spend in pursuing these things, at the expense of neglecting Christ.::David Wilkerson
A final word: I am not knowledgeable about the internet. I do not have a computer. I guess that at 74 years of age, I don't have the patience to learn.::David Wilkerson
God has never, in the history of mankind, allowed his name to go long offended.::David Wilkerson
How quickly we forget God's great deliverances in our lives. How easily we take for granted the miracles he performed in our past.::David Wilkerson
In these times, God's people must trust him for rest of body and soul.::David Wilkerson
The greatest fear that haunts this city is a suitcase bomb, nuclear or germ. Many people carry small gas masks. The masses here seem to be resigned to the inevitable, believing an attack of major proportions will happen.::David Wilkerson
Our nation is being led astray by ungodly judges, mayors and governors, who are given to change, defying the Constitution and substituting their own wicked agendas.::David Wilkerson
I am not officially involved now in the direction of the Teen Challenge ministry, but I rejoice that God permits me to be the father of these ministries.::David Wilkerson
The Teen Challenge Training Center on Pennsylvania farmland houses over 200 men in rehab. Other farms and centers have been birthed out of this ministry all over the world.::David Wilkerson
The Teen Challenge ministry was born out of those humble early days of ministry. It now includes over 500 drug and alcohol rehab centers around the world, even in Muslim countries. These include homes for girls and women addicts and alcoholics, all which are reaching many.::David Wilkerson
The unproductive tillage of human cattle takes that which of right belongs to free labor, and which is necessary for the support and happiness of our own race.::David Wilmot
The Peking man was a thinking being, standing erect, dating to the beginning of the Ice Age.::Davidson Black
We must not permit our respect for the dead or our sympathy for the living to lead us into an act of injustice to the balance of the living.::Davy Crockett
The enemy fought with savage fury, and met death with all its horrors, without shrinking or complaining: not one asked to be spared, but fought as long as they could stand or sit.::Davy Crockett
If one man in the country could take all the money, what was the use of passing any bills about it?::Davy Crockett
The party in power, like Jonah's gourd, grew up quickly, and will quickly fall.::Davy Crockett
I have always supported measures and principles and not men.::Davy Crockett
Heaven knows that I have done all that a mortal could do, to save the people, and the failure was not my fault, but the fault of others.::Davy Crockett
We have the right as individuals to give away as much of our own money as we please in charity but as members of Congress we have no right to appropriate a dollar of the public money.::Davy Crockett
It's a beautiful thing, diving into the cool crisp water and then just sort of being able to pull your body through the water and the water opening up for you.::Dawn Fraser
I m up at 5 in the morning and in bed by 10 in the evening.::DeForest Kelley
The most important influence in my childhood was my father.::DeForest Kelley
The best thing about the future is that it comes only one day at a time.::Dean Acheson
The most important aspect of the relationship between the president and the secretary of state is that they both understand who is president.::Dean Acheson
No people in history have ever survived who thought they could protect their freedom by making themselves inoffensive to their enemies.::Dean Acheson
Always remember that the future comes one day at a time.::Dean Acheson
I feel sorry for people who don't drink. They wake up in the morning and that's the best they're going to feel all day.::Dean Martin
I'd hate to be a teetotaler. Imagine getting up in the morning and knowing that's as good as you're going to feel all day.::Dean Martin
If you drink don't drive. Don't even putt.::Dean Martin
If you make every game a life and death proposition, you're going to have problems. For one thing, you'll be dead a lot.::Dean Smith
The presidents of colleges have to have some courage to step forward. You can't limit alcohol in college sports, you have to get rid of it.::Dean Smith
It is essential to employ, trust, and reward those whose perspective, ability, and judgment are radically different from yours. It is also rare, for it requires uncommon humility, tolerance, and wisdom.::Dee Hock
The prudent course is to make an investment in learning, testing and understanding, determine how the new concepts compare to how you now operate and thoughtfully determine how they apply to what you want to achieve in the future.::Dee Hock
Success follows those adept at preserving the substance of the past by clothing it in the forms of the future.::Dee Hock
If you don't understand that you work for your mislabeled 'subordinates,' then you know nothing of leadership. You know only tyranny.::Dee Hock
My doctor explained that exercise and diet changes might help and that I also might need a medication.::Della Reese
My mother was a personal friend of God's. They had ongoing conversations.::Della Reese
When you really believe in God, it gives you a courage, a confidence that enables you to meet the things coming.::Della Reese

Time is the school in which we learn, time is the fire in which we burn.::Delmore Schwartz
Business is other people's money.::Delphine de Girardin

Keep a cool head and maintain a low profile. Never take the lead - but aim to do something big.::Deng Xiaoping
The United States brags about its political system, but the President says one thing during the election, something else when he takes office, something else at midterm and something else when he leaves.::Deng Xiaoping
Pithy sentences are like sharp nails which force truth upon our memory.::Denis Diderot

Man will never be free until the last king is strangled with the entrails of the last priest.::Denis Diderot
No man has received from nature the right to command his fellow human beings.::Denis Diderot

Good music is very close to primitive language.::Denis Diderot
Although a man may wear fine clothing, if he lives peacefully and is good, self-possessed, has faith and is pure and if he does not hurt any living being, he is a holy man.::Denis Diderot

The philosopher has never killed any priests, whereas the priest has killed a great many philosophers.::Denis Diderot
There are three principal means of acquiring knowledge... observation of nature, reflection, and experimentation. Observation collects facts reflection combines them experimentation verifies the result of that combination.::Denis Diderot

It is not human nature we should accuse but the despicable conventions that pervert it.::Denis Diderot
The possibility of divorce renders both marriage partners stricter in their observance of the duties they owe to each other. Divorces help to improve morals and to increase the population.::Denis Diderot
Disturbances in society are never more fearful than when those who are stirring up the trouble can use the pretext of religion to mask their true designs.::Denis Diderot
Patriotism is an ephemeral motive that scarcely ever outlasts the particular threat to society that aroused it.::Denis Diderot
There is only one passion, the passion for happiness.::Denis Diderot
We swallow greedily any lie that flatters us, but we sip only little by little at a truth we find bitter.::Denis Diderot
Genius is present in every age, but the men carrying it within them remain benumbed unless extraordinary events occur to heat up and melt the mass so that it flows forth.::Denis Diderot
When superstition is allowed to perform the task of old age in dulling the human temperament, we can say goodbye to all excellence in poetry, in painting, and in music.::Denis Diderot
Poetry must have something in it that is barbaric, vast and wild.::Denis Diderot
Only passions, great passions can elevate the soul to great things.::Denis Diderot
If there is one realm in which it is essential to be sublime, it is in wickedness. You spit on a petty thief, but you can't deny a kind of respect for the great criminal.::Denis Diderot
When science, art, literature, and philosophy are simply the manifestation of personality they are on a level where glorious and dazzling achievements are possible, which can make a man's name live for thousands of years.::Denis Diderot
Power acquired by violence is only a usurpation, and lasts only as long as the force of him who commands prevails over that of those who obey.::Denis Diderot

And Americans realized that native people are still here, that they have a moral standing, a legal standing.::Dennis Banks
To be selected was an honor, and in respect of the family member chosen to run, families held feasts and gave away prized beaver coats, quilled tobacco bags and buffalo hides.::Dennis Banks
Poetry is plucking at the heartstrings, and making music with them.::Dennis Gabor
The most important and urgent problems of the technology of today are no longer the satisfactions of the primary needs or of archetypal wishes, but the reparation of the evils and damages by the technology of yesterday.::Dennis Gabor
The thing about imagination is that by the very act of putting it down, there must be some truth in one's own imagination.::Dennis Potter
The knowledge that we have about what it is to be human that we have as a child is something we necessarily must lose.::Dennis Potter

I am an actor and I live in the world of pretend in my working capacity. I live in the world of my imagination.::Derek Jacobi
Ellis Peters's historical detail is very accurate and very minute, and therefore is not only interesting to read but good for an actor to acquire a sense of the period. And the other thing I think is that an actor lives in the land of imagination.::Derek Jacobi
Real-life people are often the hardest to play, people that you recreate who have actually lived, because you have to live up to people's knowledge of those characters.::Derek Jacobi

I think my parents were happy that I'd gone to university and gotten a degree in history so they thought, 'Well if acting doesn't work for him, he can always become a history teacher or something.' Fortunately, the acting worked out.::Derek Jacobi
Ultimately it's a leap of faith and a leap of imagination to put yourself back in time into those conditions and situations and see how you would react.::Derek Jacobi
The English language is nobody's special property. It is the property of the imagination: it is the property of the language itself.::Derek Walcott
Visual surprise is natural in the Caribbean it comes with the landscape, and faced with its beauty, the sigh of History dissolves.::Derek Walcott
Failure is the most terrible thing in our business. When we fail, the whole world knows about it.::Desi Arnaz
No matter how old we become, we can still call them 'Holy Mother' and 'Father' and put a child-like trust in them.::Desmond Morris
Life is like a very short visit to a toyshop between birth and death.::Desmond Morris
All the United States, it is a society that is split like to the bottom, that had very poor people in the country that is one of the wealthiest countries.::Desmond Tutu
In many ways, when you're a Nobel peace laureate, you have an obligation to humankind, to society.::Desmond Tutu
Hope is being able to see that there is light despite all of the darkness.::Desmond Tutu
But God can only smile because only God can know what is coming next.::Desmond Tutu
Without forgiveness, there's no future.::Desmond Tutu
God's love is too great to be confined to any one side of a conflict or to any one religion.::Desmond Tutu
In my country of South Africa, we struggled for years against the evil system of apartheid that divided human beings, children of the same God, by racial classification and then denied many of them fundamental human rights.::Desmond Tutu
God's dream is that you and I and all of us will realize that we are family, that we are made for togetherness, for goodness, and for compassion.::Desmond Tutu
Isn't it amazing that we are all made in God's image, and yet there is so much diversity among his people?::Desmond Tutu
If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor. If an elephant has its foot on the tail of a mouse and you say that you are neutral, the mouse will not appreciate your neutrality.::Desmond Tutu
Exclusion is never the way forward on our shared paths to freedom and justice.::Desmond Tutu
God is not upset that Gandhi was not a Christian, because God is not a Christian! All of God's children and their different faiths help us to realize the immensity of God.::Desmond Tutu
In South Africa, we could not have achieved our freedom and just peace without the help of people around the world, who through the use of non-violent means, such as boycotts and divestment, encouraged their governments and other corporate actors to reverse decades-long support for the Apartheid regime.::Desmond Tutu
Your ordinary acts of love and hope point to the extraordinary promise that every human life is of inestimable value.::Desmond Tutu
When we see the face of a child, we think of the future. We think of their dreams about what they might become, and what they might accomplish.::Desmond Tutu
The God who existed before any religion counts on you to make the oneness of the human family known and celebrated.::Desmond Tutu
In God's family, there are no outsiders, no enemies.::Desmond Tutu
Peace comes when you talk to the guy you most hate. And that's where the courage of a leader comes, because when you sit down with your enemy, you as a leader must already have very considerable confidence from your own constituency.::Desmond Tutu
You don't choose your family. They are God's gift to you, as you are to them.::Desmond Tutu
Forgiveness says you are given another chance to make a new beginning.::Desmond Tutu
If you want peace, you don't talk to your friends. You talk to your enemies.::Desmond Tutu
I am a leader by default, only because nature does not allow a vacuum.::Desmond Tutu
Do your little bit of good where you are its those little bits of good put together that overwhelm the world.::Desmond Tutu
Before Nelson Mandela was arrested in 1962, he was an angry, relatively young man. He founded the ANC's military wing. When he was released, he surprised everyone because he was talking about reconciliation and forgiveness and not about revenge.::Desmond Tutu
In its history, Europe has committed so many massacres and horrors that it should bow its own head in shame.::Desmond Tutu
Inclusive, good-quality education is a foundation for dynamic and equitable societies.::Desmond Tutu
Universal education is not only a moral imperative but an economic necessity, to pave the way toward making many more nations self-sufficient and self-sustaining.::Desmond Tutu
I don't think I've ever felt that same kind of peace, the kind of serenity that I felt after acknowledging that maybe I was going to die of this TB.::Desmond Tutu
We may be surprised at the people we find in heaven. God has a soft spot for sinners. His standards are quite low.::Desmond Tutu
The price of freedom is eternal vigilance.::Desmond Tutu
The minute you got the Nobel Peace Prize, things that I said yesterday, with nobody paying too much attention, I say the same things after I got it - oh! It was quite crucial for people, and it helped our morale because apartheid did look invincible.::Desmond Tutu
Because forgiveness is like this: a room can be dank because you have closed the windows, you've closed the curtains. But the sun is shining outside, and the air is fresh outside. In order to get that fresh air, you have to get up and open the window and draw the curtains apart.::Desmond Tutu
It is our moral obligation to give every child the very best education possible.::Desmond Tutu
Jazz to me is a living music. It's a music that since its beginning has expressed the feelings, the dreams, hopes, of the people.::Dexter Gordon
You have to keep your sanity as well as know how to distance yourself from it while still holding onto the reins tightly. That is a very difficult thing to do, but I'm learning.::Diahann Carroll
When you realize the value of all life, you dwell less on what is past and concentrate more on the preservation of the future.::Dian Fossey
I will know how to hold you just by the look in your eye, I will never forget - not even on the day that I die. This is a promise of my passion for you, smile at me and make it true.::Diana Lynn
Poor, darling fellow - he died of food. He was killed by the dinner table.::Diana Vreeland
I mean one of the things about being alone is that you've no people to define yourself off, I mean, people are like all-round mirrors, because let's face it, we don't often see ourselves all round in a mirror anyway, do we.::Diana Wynne Jones
Men are but children of a larger growth, Our appetites as apt to change as theirs, And full as craving too, and full as vain.::Diane Arbus
Most people go through life dreading they'll have a traumatic experience. Freaks were born with their trauma. They've already passed their test in life. They're aristocrats.::Diane Arbus
The best part of learning any profession, when you're really going through those huge stretching escalated times of learning and energy, is when you want to do it so much.::Diane Cilento
I got through my teen years by being a bit of a clown.::Diane Cilento
I sort of was good at writing essays. I was never very good at mathematics, and I was never very good at algebra. I loved science, but I wasn't sure of it.::Diane Cilento
Not having to own a car has made me realize what a waste of time the automobile is.::Diane Johnson
I think one of the things that language poets are very involved with is getting away from conventional ideas of beauty, because those ideas contain a certain attitude toward women, certain attitudes toward sex, certain attitudes toward race, etc.::Diane Wakoski
I think that great poetry is the most interesting and complex use of the poet's language at that point in history, and so it's even more exciting when you read a poet like Yeats, almost 100 years old now, and you think that perhaps no one can really top that.::Diane Wakoski
PC stuff just lowers the general acceptance of good work and replaces it with bogus poetry that celebrates values that in themselves are probably quite worthy.::Diane Wakoski
Still, language is resilient, and poetry when it is pressured simply goes underground.::Diane Wakoski
I have always wanted what I have now come to call the voice of personal narrative. That has always been the appealing voice in poetry. It started for me lyrically in Shakespeare's sonnets.::Diane Wakoski
I don't like political poetry, and I don't write it. If this question was pointing towards that, I think it is missing the point of the American tradition, which is always apolitical, even when the poetry comes out of politically active writers.::Diane Wakoski
I'm perfectly happy when I look out at an audience and it's all women. I always think it's kind of odd, but then, more women than men, I think, read and write poetry.::Diane Wakoski
I think that's what poetry does. It allows people to come together and identify with a common thing that is outside of themselves, but which they identify with from the interior.::Diane Wakoski
American poetry, like American painting, is always personal with an emphasis on the individuality of the poet.::Diane Wakoski
But I don't think that poetry is a good, to use a contemporary word, venue, for current events.::Diane Wakoski
From reading a previous answer, you know that I consider all those aspects to be part of American cultural myth and thus they figure into good American poetry, whether the poet is aware of what he is doing or not.::Diane Wakoski
But I am not political in the current events sense, and I have never wanted anyone to read my poetry that way.::Diane Wakoski
Because, in fact, women, feminists, do read my poetry, and they read it often with the power of their political interpretation. I don't care that's what poetry is supposed to do.::Diane Wakoski
I think I'm a very good reader of poetry, but obviously, like everybody, I have a set of criteria for reading poems, and I'm not shy about presenting them, so if people ask for my critical response to a poem, I tell them what works and why, and what doesn't work and why.::Diane Wakoski
Distinctly American poetry is usually written in the context of one's geographic landscape, sometimes out of one's cultural myths, and often with reference to gender and race or ethnic origins.::Diane Wakoski
I definitely wish to distinguish American poetry from British or other English language poetry.::Diane Wakoski
High and low culture come together in all Post Modern art, and American poetry is not excluded from this.::Diane Wakoski
For the life of me, I don't understand what honest motive there is in putting this in front of this body to philosophically debate marriage on a constitutional amendment that is not going to happen, and which is enormously divisive in all of our communities.::Dianne Feinstein
Rogue internet pharmacies continue to pose a serious threat to the health and safety of Americans. Simply put, a few unethical physicians and pharmacists have become drug suppliers to a nation.::Dianne Feinstein
Today we have a health insurance industry where the first and foremost goal is to maximize profits for shareholders and CEOs, not to cover patients who have fallen ill or to compensate doctors and hospitals for their services. It is an industry that is increasingly concentrated and where Americans are paying more to receive less.::Dianne Feinstein
I basically believe the medical insurance industry should be nonprofit, not profit-making. There is no way a health reform plan will work when it is implemented by an industry that seeks to return money to shareholders instead of using that money to provide health care.::Dianne Feinstein
Instead of starting a new nuclear arms race, now is the time to reclaim our Nation's position of leadership on nuclear nonproliferation efforts.::Dianne Feinstein
The criteria for serving one's country should be competence, courage and willingness to serve. When we deny people the chance to serve because of their sexual orientation, we deprive them of their rights of citizenship, and we deprive our armed forces the service of willing and capable Americans.::Dianne Feinstein
'No Child Left Behind' requires states and school districts to ensure that all students are learning and are reaching their highest potential. Special education students should not be left out of these accountability mechanisms.::Dianne Feinstein
Ninety percent of leadership is the ability to communicate something people want.::Dianne Feinstein
I thought it was amazing to work with authors, to get a manuscript and try to make up a cover for it.::Dick Bruna
Humor is always based on a modicum of truth. Have you ever heard a joke about a father-in-law?::Dick Clark
There's a saying. If you want someone to love you forever, buy a dog, feed it and keep it around.::Dick Dale
I don't play pyrotechnic scales. I play about frustration, patience, anger. Music is an extension of my soul.::Dick Dale
I always wanted a guitar. I always wanted to be a cowboy singer because I also listened to Hank Williams, and he would always sing these neat romantic songs.::Dick Dale
When I first broke through, there was only NBC, CBS and ABC, and they had news in the morning and in the evening - there wasn't no 24-hour news.::Dick Gregory
People with high blood pressure, diabetes - those are conditions brought about by life style. If you change the life style, those conditions will leave.::Dick Gregory
My mother was the sweetest lady who ever lived on this planet, but if you tried to tell her that Jesus wasn't a Christian, she would stomp you to death.::Dick Gregory
In most places in the country, voting is looked upon as a right and a duty, but in Chicago it's a sport.::Dick Gregory
I buy about $1,500 worth of papers every month. Not that I trust them. I'm looking for the crack in the fabric.::Dick Gregory
We used to root for the Indians against the cavalry, because we didn't think it was fair in the history books that when the cavalry won it was a great victory, and when the Indians won it was a massacre.::Dick Gregory
I never learned hate at home, or shame. I had to go to school for that.::Dick Gregory
Let me tell you, never before in the history of this planet has anybody made the progress that African-Americans have made in a 30-year period, in spite of many black folks and white folks lying to one another.::Dick Gregory
It's cool to be healthy.::Dick Gregory
When you have a good mother and no father, God kind of sits in. It's not enough, but it helps.::Dick Gregory
Political promises are much like marriage vows. They are made at the beginning of the relationship between candidate and voter, but are quickly forgotten.::Dick Gregory
You know, I always say white is not a colour, white is an attitude, and if you haven't got trillions of dollars in the bank that you don't need, you can't be white.::Dick Gregory
And we love to dance, especially that new one called the Civil War Twist. The Northern part of you stands still while the Southern part tries to secede.::Dick Gregory
You hear entertainers all the time, saying, 'If I couldn't get paid for this, I'd do it for free.' When's the last time you ever heard a business person say, 'If I couldn't get paid for being chairman of British Petroleum, I'd do it for free'?::Dick Gregory
I began learning the sportswriting business very early in life.::Dick Schaap
I wanted to be a sportswriter because I loved sports and I could not hit the curve ball, the jump shot, or the opposing ball carrier.::Dick Schaap
It's kind of ironic that the two sports with the greatest characters, boxing and horse racing, have both been on the decline. In both cases it's for the lack of a suitable hero.::Dick Schaap
Women will never be as successful as men because they have no wives to advise them.::Dick Van Dyke
Bob Hope, like Mark Twain, had a sense of humor that was uniquely American, and like Twain, we'll likely not see another like him.::Dick Van Dyke
I love cats.::Dick Van Patten
Good design is making something intelligible and memorable. Great design is making something memorable and meaningful.::Dieter Rams
The ultimate test of a moral society is the kind of world that it leaves to its children.::Dietrich Bonhoeffer
It is the nature, and the advantage, of strong people that they can bring out the crucial questions and form a clear opinion about them. The weak always have to decide between alternatives that are not their own.::Dietrich Bonhoeffer
We must learn to regard people less in light of what they do or omit to do, and more in the light of what they suffer.::Dietrich Bonhoeffer
The essence of optimism is that it takes no account of the present, but it is a source of inspiration, of vitality and hope where others have resigned it enables a man to hold his head high, to claim the future for himself and not to abandon it to his enemy.::Dietrich Bonhoeffer
Human love has little regard for the truth. It makes the truth relative, since nothing, not even the truth, must come between it and the beloved person.::Dietrich Bonhoeffer
One act of obedience is better than one hundred sermons.::Dietrich Bonhoeffer
The test of the morality of a society is what it does for its children.::Dietrich Bonhoeffer
Politics are not the task of a Christian.::Dietrich Bonhoeffer
A god who let us prove his existence would be an idol.::Dietrich Bonhoeffer
God's truth judges created things out of love, and Satan's truth judges them out of envy and hatred.::Dietrich Bonhoeffer
In Romanticism, the main determinant is the mood, the atmosphere. And in that regard, you could also describe Schubert as a Romantic.::Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau
You can't do opera when already from the 10th row you can only see little dolls on the stage. In such an enormous space you can't put much faith in the personal presence of the individual singer, which is reflected in facial expressions, among other things.::Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau
I looked at films as a career from necessity but all I have really wanted is my home and children. The two things just do not work out together when one has to leave home at 5.30 am in the morning to go to the studio.::Dinah Sheridan
The best money advice ever given me was from my father. When I was a little girl, he told me, 'Don't spend anything unless you have to.'::Dinah Shore
The foundation of every state is the education of its youth.::Diogenes
Those who have virtue always in their mouths, and neglect it in practice, are like a harp, which emits a sound pleasing to others, while itself is insensible of the music.::Diogenes
When I look upon seamen, men of science and philosophers, man is the wisest of all beings when I look upon priests and prophets nothing is as contemptible as man.::Diogenes
It is the privilege of the gods to want nothing, and of godlike men to want little.::Diogenes
I am not an Athenian or a Greek, but a citizen of the world.::Diogenes
Man is the most intelligent of the animals - and the most silly.::Diogenes
Wise kings generally have wise counselors and he must be a wise man himself who is capable of distinguishing one.::Diogenes
Dogs and philosophers do the greatest good and get the fewest rewards.::Diogenes
Men talk of killing time, while time quietly kills them.::Dion Boucicault
Learning can take place in the backyard if there is a human being there who cares about the child. Before learning computers, children should learn to read first. They should sit around the dinner table and hear what their parents have to say and think.::Dixie Carter
The doctors x-rayed my head and found nothing.::Dizzy Dean
I don't care much about music. What I like is sounds.::Dizzy Gillespie
The heart of the jealous knows the best and most satisfying love, that of the other's bed, where the rival perfects the lover's imperfections.::Djuna Barnes
Dreams have only the pigmentation of fact.::Djuna Barnes
Work, look for peace and calm in work: you will find it nowhere else.::Dmitri Mendeleev
I'd think learning to play the guitar would be very confusing for sighted people.::Doc Watson
Time takes the ugliness and horror out of death and turns it into beauty.::Dodie Smith
It is one of my sources of happiness never to desire a knowledge of other people's business.::Dolley Madison
The anger that Uncle Junior has comes from my background. My father was the son of an Italian immigrant, and I've seen the fire of the Italian temperament. It can be explosive sometimes in ways that are both funny and tragic.::Dominic Chianese
I like getting married, but I don't like being married.::Don Adams
If you look at the game and everything, it's not quite like looking at an animated film, because that's total character. This, this is really movement, but it's got funny little things if you look for the humor. They're actually getting to the character.::Don Bluth
If the machines can take the drudgery out of it and just leave us with the joy of drawing, then that's the best of both worlds - and I'll use those computers!::Don Bluth
I have never seen a game's graphics look so sharp and clean. The sound design for the game is also unique on the Xbox. The memory on this system allowed us to provide the user with 5.1 Dolby surround sound for home theatre owners.::Don Bluth
Californians invented the concept of life-style. This alone warrants their doom.::Don DeLillo
I saw a photograph of a wedding conducted by Reverend Moon of the Unification Church. I wanted to understand this event, and the only way to understand it was to write about it.::Don DeLillo
I think more than writers, the major influences on me have been European movies, jazz, and Abstract Expressionism.::Don DeLillo
I slept for four years. I didn't study much of anything. I majored in something called communication arts.::Don DeLillo
I watch movies occasionally, and I watch documentaries. Virtually nothing else.::Don DeLillo
The writer is the person who stands outside society, independent of affiliation and independent of influence.::Don DeLillo
In the face of technology, everything becomes a little atavistic.::Don DeLillo
In a repressive society, a writer can be deeply influential, but in a society that's filled with glut and repetition and endless consumption, the act of terror may be the only meaningful act.::Don DeLillo
People who are powerless make an open theater of violence.::Don DeLillo
There's always a period of curious fear between the first sweet-smelling breeze and the time when the rain comes cracking down.::Don DeLillo
People who are in power make their arrangements in secret, largely as a way of maintaining and furthering that power.::Don DeLillo
There's a connection between the advances that are made in technology and the sense of primitive fear people develop in response to it.::Don DeLillo
I felt Joyce was an influence on my fiction, but in a very general way, as a kind of inspiration and a model for the beauty of language.::Don DeLillo
Never underestimate the power of the State to act out its own massive fantasies.::Don DeLillo
The future belongs to crowds.::Don DeLillo
There is nobody so irritating as somebody with less intelligence and more sense than we have.::Don Herold
It takes a lot of things to prove you are smart, but only one thing to prove you are ignorant.::Don Herold
A humorist is a person who feels bad, but who feels good about it.::Don Herold
Machiavelli taught me it was better to be feared than loved. Because if you are loved they sense you might be weak. I am a man of the people and help them but it is important to do so through strength.::Don King
If you cast your bread upon the water and you have faith, you'll get back cash. If you don't have faith, you'll get soggy bread.::Don King
Mainly, I thought of Barney as a kid. You can always look into the faces of kids and see what they're thinking, if they're happy or sad. That's what I tried to do with Barney.::Don Knotts
I have often noticed that ancestors never boast of the descendants who boast of ancestors. I would rather start a family than finish one. Blood will tell, but often it tells too much.::Don Marquis
Writing a book of poetry is like dropping a rose petal down the Grand Canyon and waiting for the echo.::Don Marquis
Every cloud has its silver lining but it is sometimes a little difficult to get it to the mint.::Don Marquis
Poetry is what Milton saw when he went blind.::Don Marquis
Punctuality is one of the cardinal business virtues: always insist on it in your subordinates.::Don Marquis
Procrastination is the art of keeping up with yesterday.::Don Marquis
Publishing a volume of verse is like dropping a rose petal down the Grand Canyon and waiting for the echo.::Don Marquis
Age is not a particularly interesting subject. Anyone can get old. All you have to do is live long enough.::Don Marquis
Middle age is the time when a man is always thinking that in a week or two he will feel as good as ever.::Don Marquis
When a man tells you that he got rich through hard work, ask him: 'Whose?'::Don Marquis
Happiness is the interval between periods of unhappiness.::Don Marquis
An optimist is a guy that has never had much experience.::Don Marquis
I would rather start a family than finish one.::Don Marquis
One of the most important things to remember about infant care is: don't change diapers in midstream.::Don Marquis
A pessimist is a person who has had to listen to too many optimists.::Don Marquis
We pay for the mistakes of our ancestors, and it seems only fair that they should leave us the money to pay with.::Don Marquis
Of middle age the best that can be said is that a middle-aged person has likely learned how to have a little fun in spite of his troubles.::Don Marquis
There is nothing so habit-forming as money.::Don Marquis
Fate often puts all the material for happiness and prosperity into a man's hands just to see how miserable he can make himself with them.::Don Marquis
When you stand alone and sell yourself, you can't please everyone. But when you're different, you can last.::Don Rickles
Political correctness? In my humor, I never talk about politics. I was never much into all that.::Don Rickles
You can't study comedy it's within you. It's a personality. My humor is an attitude.::Don Rickles
To my knowledge, I was the first guy really to do what I do. And then later on different comedians started trying doing it.::Don Rickles
Some people say funny things, but I say things funny.::Don Rickles
Who picks your clothes - Stevie Wonder?::Don Rickles
Show business is my life. When I was a kid I sold insurance, but nobody laughed.::Don Rickles
Funny is funny.::Don Rickles
You know what's funny to me? Attitude.::Don Rickles
I have no idea what I'm going to say when I stand up to give a toast. But I do know that anything I say I find funny.::Don Rickles
Success is not forever and failure isn't fatal.::Don Shula
I think what coaching is all about, is taking players and analyzing there ability, put them in a position where they can excel within the framework of the team winning. And I hope that I've done that in my 33 years as a head coach.::Don Shula
And this year is going to be the 25th anniversary of the 17-0 team, the only undefeated season.::Don Shula
You know it's only 50 miles from Grand River to Canton, but it took me 67 years to travel that distance.::Don Shula
Remember in 1973 the same science chatter said that the coming Ice Age is going to occur, we're going to lose millions of people. And the politicians knew how to solve it, they just didn't have the courage to solve it they were going to put coal dust on the Arctic.::Don Young
What you lack in talent can be made up with desire, hustle and giving 110 percent all the time.::Don Zimmer
They use all of the music that I did in the '50s, '60s and the '70s behind people like Tupac and LL Cool J. I'm into all that stuff.::Donald Byrd
Now for my own case, I bless the Lord that, for all that hath been said of me, my conscience doth not condemn me. I do not say I am free of sin, but I am at peace with God through a slain Mediator and I believe that there is no salvation but only in Christ.::Donald Cargill
It is long since I could have adventured on eternity, through God's mercy and Christ's merits but death remained somewhat terrible, and that now is taken away and now death is no more to me, but to cast myself into my husband's arms, and to lie down with Him.::Donald Cargill
And now, this is the sweetest and most glorious day that ever my eyes did see.::Donald Cargill
I wish your increase in holiness, number, love, religion, and righteousness and wait you, and cease to contend with these men that are gone from us, for there is nothing that shall convince them but judgment.::Donald Cargill
Fear not and the God of mercies grant a full gale and a fair entry into His kingdom, which may carry sweetly and swiftly over the bar, that you find not the rub of death.::Donald Cargill
I wish there were more true conversion, and then there would not be so much backsliding, and, for fear of suffering, living at ease, when there are so few to contend for Christ and His cause.::Donald Cargill
I have followed holiness, I have taught truth, and I have been most in the main things not that I thought the things concerning our times little, but that I thought none could do anything to purpose in God's great and public matters, till they were right in their conditions.::Donald Cargill
I come now to tell you for what I am brought here to die, and to give you an account of my faith, which I shall do as in the sight of the living God before whom I am shortly to stand.::Donald Cargill
I loved it, but social reality impeded. Now I wander in here at 9 in the morning or so, and come back for a while in the afternoon. I am a very lenient boss.::Donald E. Westlake
Who's a boy gonna talk to if not his mother?::Donald E. Westlake
The attitude and capacity of the factory, the old metal table and the new ideas of the wooden furniture quickly and naturally suggested the possibility of metal furniture.::Donald Judd
People think that computer science is the art of geniuses but the actual reality is the opposite, just many people doing things that build on eachother, like a wall of mini stones.::Donald Knuth
Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs. Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.::Donald Knuth
Science is what we understand well enough to explain to a computer. Art is everything else we do.::Donald Knuth
Everyday life is like programming, I guess. If you love something you can put beauty into it.::Donald Knuth
I decry the current tendency to seek patents on algorithms. There are better ways to earn a living than to prevent other people from making use of one's contributions to computer science.::Donald Knuth
I currently use Ubuntu Linux, on a standalone laptop - it has no Internet connection. I occasionally carry flash memory drives between this machine and the Macs that I use for network surfing and graphics but I trust my family jewels only to Linux.::Donald Knuth
People who are more than casually interested in computers should have at least some idea of what the underlying hardware is like. Otherwise the programs they write will be pretty weird.::Donald Knuth
They put me in a harness, like a horse, to learn the back somersault. It was weird up there when I put on that harness for the first time. The courage came with practice.::Donald O'Connor
I was offered a choice of a flat salary up front or a percentage of the film's future earnings. I took the up front money. Nobody could have figured what Halloween would ultimately become.::Donald Pleasence
All the real work is done in the rehearsal period.::Donald Pleasence
Presidential leadership needn't always cost money. Look for low- and no-cost options. They can be surprisingly effective.::Donald Rumsfeld
Congress, the press, and the bureaucracy too often focus on how much money or effort is spent, rather than whether the money or effort actually achieves the announced goal.::Donald Rumsfeld
Amidst all the clutter, beyond all the obstacles, aside from all the static, are the goals set. Put your head down, do the best job possible, let the flak pass, and work towards those goals.::Donald Rumsfeld
Leave the President's family business to him. You will have plenty to do without trying to manage the First Family. They are likely to do fine without your help.::Donald Rumsfeld
Don't necessarily avoid sharp edges. Occasionally they are necessary to leadership.::Donald Rumsfeld
Secretary Powell and I agree on every single issue that has ever been before this administration except for those instances where Colin's still learning.::Donald Rumsfeld
Death has a tendency to encourage a depressing view of war.::Donald Rumsfeld
Many people around the President have sizeable egos before entering government, some with good reason. Their new positions will do little to moderate their egos.::Donald Rumsfeld
You will launch many projects, but have time to finish only a few. So think, plan, develop, launch and tap good people to be responsible. Give them authority and hold them accountable. Trying to do too much yourself creates a bottleneck.::Donald Rumsfeld
Let your family, staff, and friends know that you're still the same person, despite all the publicity and notoriety that accompanies your position.::Donald Rumsfeld
Your performance depends on your people. Select the best, train them and back them. When errors occur, give sharper guidance. If errors persist or if the fit feels wrong, help them move on. The country cannot afford amateur hour in the White House.::Donald Rumsfeld
The Federal Government should be the last resort, not the first. Ask if a potential program is truly a federal responsibility or whether it can better be handled privately, by voluntary organizations, or by local or state governments.::Donald Rumsfeld
Imagine, a September 11 with weapons of mass destruction. It's not 3,000. It's tens of thousands of innocent men, women and children.::Donald Rumsfeld
In politics, every day is filled with numerous opportunities for serious error. Enjoy it.::Donald Rumsfeld
In our system leadership is by consent, not command. To lead a President must persuade. Personal contacts and experiences help shape his thinking. They can be critical to his persuasiveness and thus to his leadership.::Donald Rumsfeld
First rule of politics: you can't win unless you're on the ballot. Second rule: If you run, you may lose. And, if you tie, you do not win.::Donald Rumsfeld
In the execution of Presidential decisions work to be true to his views, in fact and tone.::Donald Rumsfeld
The price of being close to the President is delivering bad news. You fail him if you don't tell him the truth. Others won't do it.::Donald Rumsfeld
Be yourself. Follow your instincts. Success depends, at least in part, on the ability to 'carry it off.'::Donald Rumsfeld

Of the various forms of government which have prevailed in the world, an hereditary monarchy seems to present the fairest scope for ridicule.::Edward Gibbon
Our work is the presentation of our capabilities.::Edward Gibbon
History is little more than the register of the crimes, follies, and misfortunes of mankind.::Edward Gibbon

Abhorrence of apartheid is a moral attitude, not a policy.::Edward Heath
I find in working always the disturbing intrusion of elements not a part of my most interested vision, and the inevitable obliteration and replacement of this vision by the work itself as it proceeds.::Edward Hopper
The question of the value of nationality in art is perhaps unsolvable.::Edward Hopper
If the technical innovations of the Impressionists led merely to a more accurate representation of nature, it was perhaps of not much value in enlarging their powers of expression.::Edward Hopper
There will be, I think, an attempt to grasp again the surprise and accidents of nature and a more intimate and sympathetic study of its moods, together with a renewed wonder and humility on the part of such as are still capable of these basic reactions.::Edward Hopper
My aim in painting has always been the most exact transcription possible of my most intimate impression of nature.::Edward Hopper
Painting will have to deal more fully and less obliquely with life and nature's phenomena before it can again become great.::Edward Hopper
In its most limited sense, modern, art would seem to concern itself only with the technical innovations of the period.::Edward Hopper
The trend in some of the contemporary movements in art, but by no means all, seems to deny this ideal and to me appears to lead to a purely decorative conception of painting.::Edward Hopper
No amount of skillful invention can replace the essential element of imagination.::Edward Hopper
I trust Winsor and Newton and I paint directly upon it.::Edward Hopper
It's to paint directly on the canvas without any funny business, as it were, and I use almost pure turpentine to start with, adding oil as I go along until the medium becomes pure oil. I use as little oil as I can possibly help, and that's my method.::Edward Hopper
In general it can be said that a nation's art is greatest when it most reflects the character of its people.::Edward Hopper

I was much distressed by next door people who had twin babies and played the violin but one of the twins died, and the other has eaten the fiddle, so all is peace.::Edward Lear
A book is the only place in which you can examine a fragile thought without breaking it, or explore an explosive idea without fear it will go off in your face. It is one of the few havens remaining where a man's mind can get both provocation and privacy.::Edward P. Morgan
A satellite has no conscience.::Edward R. Murrow
We cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home.::Edward R. Murrow
The speed of communications is wondrous to behold. It is also true that speed can multiply the distribution of information that we know to be untrue.::Edward R. Murrow

Human beings do not live in the objective world alone, nor alone in the world of social activity as ordinarily understood, but are very much at the mercy of the particular language which has become the medium of expression for their society.::Edward Sapir
The attitude of independence toward a constructed language which all national speakers must adopt is really a great advantage, because it tends to make man see himself as the master of language instead of its obedient servant.::Edward Sapir
It is no secret that the fruits of language study are in no sort of relation to the labour spent on teaching and learning them.::Edward Sapir
English, once accepted as an international language, is no more secure than French has proved to be as the one and only accepted language of diplomacy or as Latin has proved to be as the international language of science.::Edward Sapir
The modern mind tends to be more and more critical and analytical in spirit, hence it must devise for itself an engine of expression which is logically defensible at every point and which tends to correspond to the rigorous spirit of modern science.::Edward Sapir
A firm, for instance, that does business in many countries of the world is driven to spend an enormous amount of time, labour, and money in providing for translation services.::Edward Sapir

Cultural anthropology is more and more rapidly getting to realize itself as a strictly historical science.::Edward Sapir
Photography is a major force in explaining man to man.::Edward Steichen
Photography records the gamut of feelings written on the human face, the beauty of the earth and skies that man has inherited, and the wealth and confusion man has created. It is a major force in explaining man to man.::Edward Steichen
Every other artist begins with a blank canvas, a piece of paper the photographer begins with the finished product.::Edward Steichen
When that shutter clicks, anything else that can be done afterward is not worth consideration.::Edward Steichen
I knew, of course, that trees and plants had roots, stems, bark, branches and foliage that reached up toward the light. But I was coming to realize that the real magician was light itself.::Edward Steichen
We should never denigrate any other culture but rather help people to understand the relationship between their own culture and the dominant culture. When you understand another culture or language, it does not mean that you have to lose your own culture.::Edward T. Hall
The main purpose of science is simplicity and as we understand more things, everything is becoming simpler.::Edward Teller

The science of today is the technology of tomorrow.::Edward Teller
Human folk are as a matter of fact eager to find intelligence in animals.::Edward Thorndike
From the lowest animals of which we can affirm intelligence up to man this type of intellect is found.::Edward Thorndike
Human education is concerned with certain changes in the intellects, characters and behavior of men, its problems being roughly included under these four topics: Aims, materials, means and methods.::Edward Thorndike
There is no reasoning, no process of inference or comparison there is no thinking about things, no putting two and two together there are no ideas - the animal does not think of the box or of the food or of the act he is to perform.::Edward Thorndike
Just as the science and art of agriculture depend upon chemistry and botany, so the art of education depends upon physiology and psychology.::Edward Thorndike
Psychology is the science of the intellects, characters and behavior of animals including man.::Edward Thorndike
The real difference between a man's scientific judgments about himself and the judgment of others about him is he has added sources of knowledge.::Edward Thorndike
Human beings are accustomed to think of intellect as the power of having and controlling ideas and of ability to learn as synonymous with ability to have ideas. But learning by having ideas is really one of the rare and isolated events in nature.::Edward Thorndike
Photography suits the temper of this age - of active bodies and minds. It is a perfect medium for one whose mind is teeming with ideas, imagery, for a prolific worker who would be slowed down by painting or sculpting, for one who sees quickly and acts decisively, accurately.::Edward Weston
There is something about poetry beyond prose logic, there is mystery in it, not to be explained but admired.::Edward Young

The clouds may drop down titles and estates, and wealth may seek us, but wisdom must be sought.::Edward Young
Our birth is nothing but our death begun, As tapers waste the moment they take fire.::Edward Young
In a sense, words are encyclopedias of ignorance because they freeze perceptions at one moment in history and then insist we continue to use these frozen perceptions when we should be doing better.::Edward de Bono
Many highly intelligent people are poor thinkers. Many people of average intelligence are skilled thinkers. The power of a car is separate from the way the car is driven.::Edward de Bono

Removing the faults in a stage-coach may produce a perfect stage-coach, but it is unlikely to produce the first motor car.::Edward de Bono
Most executives, many scientists, and almost all business school graduates believe that if you analyze data, this will give you new ideas. Unfortunately, this belief is totally wrong. The mind can only see what it is prepared to see.::Edward de Bono

We need creativity in order to break free from the temporary structures that have been set up by a particular sequence of experience.::Edward de Bono
Argument is meant to reveal the truth, not to create it.::Edward de Bono
It has always surprised me how little attention philosophers have paid to humor, since it is a more significant process of mind than reason. Reason can only sort out perceptions, but the humor process is involved in changing them.::Edward de Bono
Creativity is a great motivator because it makes people interested in what they are doing. Creativity gives hope that there can be a worthwhile idea. Creativity gives the possibility of some sort of achievement to everyone. Creativity makes life more fun and more interesting.::Edward de Bono
In the future, instead of striving to be right at a high cost, it will be more appropriate to be flexible and plural at a lower cost. If you cannot accurately predict the future then you must flexibly be prepared to deal with various possible futures.::Edward de Bono
Studies have shown that 90% of error in thinking is due to error in perception. If you can change your perception, you can change your emotion and this can lead to new ideas.::Edward de Bono
The best translations cannot convey to us the strength and exquisite delicacy of thought in its native garb, and he to whom such books are shut flounders about in outer darkness.::Edwin Booth
When you are older you will understand how precious little things, seemingly of no value in themselves, can be loved and prized above all price when they convey the love and thoughtfulness of a good heart.::Edwin Booth

Not to transmit an experience is to betray it.::Elie Wiesel
It all happened so fast. The ghetto. The deportation. The sealed cattle car. The fiery altar upon which the history of our people and the future of mankind were meant to be sacrificed.::Elie Wiesel

On rare occasions one does hear of a miraculous case of a married couple falling in love after marriage, but on close examination it will be found that it is a mere adjustment to the inevitable.::Emma Goldman

When a man goes through six years training to be a doctor he will never be the same. He knows too much.::Enid Bagnold

I began revolution with 82 men. If I had to do it again, I do it with 10 or 15 and absolute faith. It does not matter how small you are if you have faith and plan of action.::Fidel Castro

The revolution is a dictatorship of the exploited against the exploiters.::Fidel Castro

To expect too much is to have a sentimental view of life and this is a softness that ends in bitterness.::Flannery O'Connor

Writing a novel is a terrible experience, during which the hair often falls out and the teeth decay.::Flannery O'Connor

Faith is what someone knows to be true, whether they believe it or not.::Flannery O'Connor
Things can be funny only when we are in fun. When we're 'dead earnest,' humor is the only thing that is dead.::Flip Wilson
I think Mr. Wilson will have to be the rest of the way alone.::Flip Wilson
Get well cards have become so humorous that if you don't get sick you're missing half the fun.::Flip Wilson
Funny is not a color. Being black is only good from the time you get from the curtain to the microphone.::Flip Wilson
Funny is an attitude.::Flip Wilson
My main point is to be funny if I can slip a message in there, fine.::Flip Wilson

Now the only thing I miss about sex is the cigarette afterward. Next to the first one in the morning, it's the best one of all. It tasted so good that even if I had been frigid I would have pretended otherwise just to be able to smoke it.::Florence King
American couples have gone to such lengths to avoid the interference of in-laws that they have to pay marriage counselors to interfere between them.::Florence King
Americans worship creativity the way they worship physical beauty - as a way of enjoying elitism without guilt: God did it.::Florence King
People are so busy dreaming the American Dream, fantasizing about what they could be or have a right to be, that they're all asleep at the switch. Consequently we are living in the Age of Human Error.::Florence King

Age puzzles me. I thought it was a quiet time. My seventies were interesting and fairly serene, but my eighties are passionate. I grow more intense as I age.::Florida Scott-Maxwell
The government would be able to go to court with respect to newspaper articles, broadcast pieces and the like that they thought were bad or harmful or even against the government and try to block them.::Floyd Abrams
It's not like learning how to hit a curve ball in baseball.::Floyd Abrams
So sometimes the facts are good and sometimes the facts are bad, the important thing from the point of view of a principle as broad and important as freedom of speech is that the courts articulate and set forth in a very protective way what those principles are.::Floyd Abrams
Fear was absolutely necessary. Without it, I would have been scared to death.::Floyd Patterson
The fighter loses more than his pride in the fight he loses part of his future. He's a step closer to the slum he came from.::Floyd Patterson

Keep your temper. A decision made in anger is never sound.::Ford Frick
I went to Sunday School and liked the stories about Christ and the Christmas star. They were beautiful. They made you warm and happy to think about. But I didn't believe them.::Frances Farmer
I used to lie between cool, clean sheets at night after I'd had a bath, after I had washed my hair and scrubbed my knuckles and finger-nails and teeth. Then I could lie quite still in the dark with my face to the window with the trees in it, and talk to God.::Frances Farmer
The Sunday School teacher talked too much in the way our grade school teacher used to when she told us about George Washington. Pleasant, pretty stories, but not true.::Frances Farmer
Most of man's problems upon this planet, in the long history of the race, have been met and solved either partially or as a whole by experiment based on common sense and carried out with courage.::Frances Perkins
How are men to be secured in any rights without instruction how to be secured in the equal exercise of those rights without equality of instruction? By instruction understand me to mean knowledge - just knowledge not talent, not genius, not inventive mental powers.::Frances Wright
Religion may be defined thus: a belief in, and homage rendered to, existences unseen and causes unknown.::Frances Wright
All that I say is, examine, inquire. Look into the nature of things. Search out the grounds of your opinions, the for and against. Know why you believe, understand what you believe, and possess a reason for the faith that is in you.::Frances Wright
If we bring not the good courage of minds covetous of truth, and truth only, prepared to hear all things, and decide upon all things, according to evidence, we should do more wisely to sit down contented in ignorance, than to bestir ourselves only to reap disappointment.::Frances Wright
If they exert it not for good, they will for evil if they advance not knowledge, they will perpetuate ignorance.::Frances Wright
These will vary in every human being but knowledge is the same for every mind, and every mind may and ought to be trained to receive it.::Frances Wright

Since there is nothing so well worth having as friends, never lose a chance to make them.::Francesco Guicciardini
When I first thought of the idea for 'Sweet Valley High,' I loved the idea of high school as microcosm of the real world. And what I really liked was how it moved things on from 'Sleeping Beauty'-esque romance novels where the girl had to wait for the hero. This would be girl-driven, very different, I decided - and indeed it is.::Francine Pascal
I get some of my ideas from watching my three daughters, but most of them come from my own memories of growing up. I can remember how romantic I was, not just about love, but romance in the classic sense - the romantic ideals: of honor and truth, of loyalty, sacrifice and fairness. Those were the elements that made a story satisfying to me.::Francine Pascal

Next to religion, let your care be to promote justice.::Francis Bacon
Knowledge and human power are synonymous.::Francis Bacon
The great end of life is not knowledge but action.::Francis Bacon
There is a wisdom in this beyond the rules of physic: a man's own observation what he finds good of and what he finds hurt of is the best physic to preserve health.::Francis Bacon
But men must know, that in this theatre of man's life it is reserved only for God and angels to be lookers on.::Francis Bacon
Acorns were good until bread was found.::Francis Bacon

I wanted to write and direct movies and not be forced to adapt them from a bestselling book.::Francis Ford Coppola
I landed a job with Roger Corman. The job was to write the English dialogue for a Russian science fiction picture. I didn't speak any Russian. He didn't care whether I could understand what they were saying he wanted me to make up dialogue.::Francis Ford Coppola
Most Italians who came to this country are very patriotic. There was this exciting possibility that if you worked real hard, and you loved something, you could become successful.::Francis Ford Coppola
When I was going for my graduate degree, I decided I was going to make a feature film as my thesis. That's what I was famous for-that I had my thesis film be a feature film, which was 'You're a Big Boy Now.'::Francis Ford Coppola
I've been offered lots of movies. There's always some actor who's doing a project and would like to have me do it. But you look at the project and think, 'Gee, there are a lot of good directors who could do that.' I'd like to do something only I can do.::Francis Ford Coppola
They needed someone to write a script of The Great Gatsby very quickly for the movie they were making. I took this job so I'd be sure to have some dough to support my family.::Francis Ford Coppola

Necessity of action takes away the fear of the act, and makes bold resolution the favorite of fortune.::Francis Quarles
Fear nothing but what thy industry may prevent be confident of nothing but what fortune cannot defeat it is no less folly to fear what is impossible to be avoided than to be secure when there is a possibility to be deprived.::Francis Quarles
Let the fear of danger be a spur to prevent it he that fears not, gives advantage to the danger.::Francis Quarles

To put down an ideogram of a table so that people will recognize it as a table is not the work of a painter, but to sense it for a moment as a magic carpet with a leg hanging down at each corner is the beginning of a painter's imagination.::Frank Auerbach
It seems to me madness to wake up in the morning and do something other than paint, considering that one may not wake up the following morning.::Frank Auerbach
I believe that in the end the abolition of war, the maintenance of world peace, the adjustment of international questions by pacific means will come through the force of public opinion, which controls nations and peoples.::Frank B. Kellogg
It is not to be expected that human nature will change in a day.::Frank B. Kellogg
Competition in armament, both land and naval, is not only a terrible burden upon the people, but I believe it to be one of the greatest menaces to the peace of the world.::Frank B. Kellogg
I know that military alliances and armament have been the reliance for peace for centuries, but they do not produce peace and when war comes, as it inevitably does under such conditions, these armaments and alliances but intensify and broaden the conflict.::Frank B. Kellogg
There has not been a war in South America for fifty years, and I have every confidence that the countries of Central and South America are deeply in earnest in the maintenance of peace.::Frank B. Kellogg
I know of no greater work for humanity than in the cause of peace, which can only be achieved by the earnest efforts of nations and peoples.::Frank B. Kellogg
Each one of these treaties is a step for the maintenance of peace, an additional guarantee against war. It is through such machinery that the disputes between nations will be settled and war prevented.::Frank B. Kellogg
I share the opinion of those of broader vision, who see in the signs of the time hope of humanity for peace.::Frank B. Kellogg
These measures may not constitute an absolute guarantee of peace, but, in my opinion, they constitute the greatest preventive measures ever adopted by nations.::Frank B. Kellogg
I know of no more important subject to the peace of Europe and the world than the reasonable reduction of armaments, especially in Europe, and of naval armaments throughout the world.::Frank B. Kellogg
Certain it is that a great responsibility rests upon the statesmen of all nations, not only to fulfill the promises for reduction in armaments, but to maintain the confidence of the people of the world in the hope of an enduring peace.::Frank B. Kellogg
It is by such means as the prize offered by your Committee that the attention of the world will be focused and that men and women will be inspired to greater efforts in the interest of peace.::Frank B. Kellogg
In our film profession you may have Gable's looks, Tracy's art, Marlene's legs or Liz's violet eyes, but they don't mean a thing without that swinging thing called courage.::Frank Capra
Intelligence is not a science.::Frank Carlucci
I can remember when I was National Security Adviser, the intelligence community told us... they put out an intelligence report saying that Iran would never back off from attacks on shipping in the Gulf if we use force.::Frank Carlucci
My understanding is that what was provided was general order of battle information, not operational intelligence. I certainly have no knowledge of US participation in preparing battle and strike packages and doubt strongly that that occurred.::Frank Carlucci
Putin has a lot at stake here and restoring the relationship with the United States, and there are already signs as Sandy mentioned that he's moving in the right direction to begin to ascertain that their trade with Iran is not used for the production of nuclear weapons.::Frank Carlucci
And I argued with that intelligence estimate and I think it is a responsibility of policymakers to use their best judgment on the basis of the intelligence they've received.::Frank Carlucci
Policymakers have to make judgments based on the best intelligence they get.::Frank Carlucci
I don't think my wife likes me very much, when I had a heart attack she wrote for an ambulance.::Frank Carson

I am accusing him of stealing my best material, he was a very funny man.::Frank Carson
Have you heard about the Irishman who reversed into a car boot sale and sold the engine?::Frank Carson
For me, every day is a new thing. I approach each project with a new insecurity, almost like the first project I ever did. And I get the sweats. I go in and start working, I'm not sure where I'm going. If I knew where I was going I wouldn't do it.::Frank Gehry
Look, architecture has a lot of places to hide behind, a lot of excuses. 'The client made me do this.' 'The city made me do this.' 'Oh, the budget.' I don't believe that anymore.::Frank Gehry
When I was a kid, my father didn't really have much hope for me. He thought I was a dreamer he didn't think I would amount to anything. My mother also.::Frank Gehry
Liquid architecture. It's like jazz - you improvise, you work together, you play off each other, you make something, they make something. And I think it's a way of - for me, it's a way of trying to understand the city, and what might happen in the city.::Frank Gehry
Architecture should speak of its time and place, but yearn for timelessness.::Frank Gehry
Gray skies are just clouds passing over.::Frank Gifford

The beginning of knowledge is the discovery of something we do not understand.::Frank Herbert
Respect for the truth comes close to being the basis for all morality.::Frank Herbert
If you think of yourselves as helpless and ineffectual, it is certain that you will create a despotic government to be your master. The wise despot, therefore, maintains among his subjects a popular sense that they are helpless and ineffectual.::Frank Herbert
Religion often partakes of the myth of progress that shields us from the terrors of an uncertain future.::Frank Herbert
Without change, something sleeps inside us, and seldom awakens. The sleeper must awaken.::Frank Herbert
When law and duty are one, united by religion, you never become fully conscious, fully aware of yourself. You are always a little less than an individual.::Frank Herbert

If you're lucky as you get older, you respect the craft and it becomes a skill.::Frank Langella
I grew up in a household where everybody lived at the top of his lungs.::Frank Langella
Each of us needs something - food, liquor, pot, whatever - to help us survive. Dracula needs blood.::Frank Langella

There are no shortcuts in life - only those we imagine.::Frank Leahy

Give me the luxuries of life and I will willingly do without the necessities.::Frank Lloyd Wright
A great architect is not made by way of a brain nearly so much as he is made by way of a cultivated, enriched heart.::Frank Lloyd Wright
An architect's most useful tools are an eraser at the drafting board, and a wrecking bar at the site.::Frank Lloyd Wright
Respect the masterpiece. It is true reverence to man. There is no quality so great, none so much needed now.::Frank Lloyd Wright
Organic buildings are the strength and lightness of the spiders' spinning, buildings qualified by light, bred by native character to environment, married to the ground.::Frank Lloyd Wright
Noble life demands a noble architecture for noble uses of noble men. Lack of culture means what it has always meant: ignoble civilization and therefore imminent downfall.::Frank Lloyd Wright
Study nature, love nature, stay close to nature. It will never fail you.::Frank Lloyd Wright
Mechanization best serves mediocrity.::Frank Lloyd Wright
The truth is more important than the facts.::Frank Lloyd Wright

I and my colleagues here have been engaged in the pursuit of knowledge.::Frederick Sanger

The truth has never been of any real value to any human being - it is a symbol for mathematicians and philosophers to pursue. In human relations kindness and lies are worth a thousand truths.::Graham Greene

I look back on my life like a good day's work, it was done and I am satisfied with it.::Grandma Moses

Science, like art, religion, commerce, warfare, and even sleep, is based on presuppositions.::Gregory Bateson
In the transmission of human culture, people always attempt to replicate, to pass on to the next generation the skills and values of the parents, but the attempt always fails because cultural transmission is geared to learning, not DNA.::Gregory Bateson

Poetry is life distilled.::Gwendolyn Brooks
Art hurts. Art urges voyages - and it is easier to stay at home.::Gwendolyn Brooks

Man is the religious animal. He is the only one that's got true religion, several of them.::Hal Holbrook
Alfred Nobel was much concerned, as are we all, with the tangible benefits we hope for and expect from physiological and medical research, and the Faculty of the Caroline Institute has ever been alert to recognize practical benefits.::Haldan Keffer Hartline
When we are afraid we ought not to occupy ourselves with endeavoring to prove that there is no danger, but in strengthening ourselves to go on in spite of the danger.::Hale White

My recollection of a hundred lovely lakes has given me blessed release from care and worry and the troubled thinking of our modern day. It has been a return to the primitive and the peaceful.::Hamlin Garland
There is nothing stronger in the world than gentleness.::Han Suyin
So much of what is best in us is bound up in our love of family, that it remains the measure of our stability because it measures our sense of loyalty. All other pacts of love or fear derive from it and are modeled upon it.::Haniel Long
I don't feel right unless I have a sport to play or at least a way to work up a sweat.::Hank Aaron
Failure is a part of success.::Hank Aaron
The triple is the most exciting play in baseball. Home runs win a lot of games, but I never understood why fans are so obsessed with them.::Hank Aaron
The thing I like about baseball is that it's one-on-one. You stand up there alone, and if you make a mistake, it's your mistake. If you hit a home run, it's your home run.::Hank Aaron
I never smile when I have a bat in my hands. That's when you've got to be serious. When I get out on the field, nothing's a joke to me. I don't feel like I should walk around with a smile on my face.::Hank Aaron
My motto was always to keep swinging. Whether I was in a slump or feeling badly or having trouble off the field, the only thing to do was keep swinging.::Hank Aaron
I'm hoping someday that some kid, black or white, will hit more home runs than myself. Whoever it is, I'd be pulling for him.::Hank Aaron
Anyone in the humor business isn't thinking clearly if he doesn't surround himself with idea people. Otherwise, you settle for mediocrity - or you burn yourself out.::Hank Ketcham
You can't be fat and fast, too so lift, run, diet and work.::Hank Stram

The sad truth is that most evil is done by people who never make up their minds to be good or evil.::Hannah Arendt
No cause is left but the most ancient of all, the one, in fact, that from the beginning of our history has determined the very existence of politics, the cause of freedom versus tyranny.::Hannah Arendt
Power and violence are opposites where the one rules absolutely, the other is absent. Violence appears where power is in jeopardy, but left to its own course it ends in power's disappearance.::Hannah Arendt
Revolutionaries do not make revolutions. The revolutionaries are those who know when power is lying in the street and then they can pick it up.::Hannah Arendt
Death not merely ends life, it also bestows upon it a silent completeness, snatched from the hazardous flux to which all things human are subject.::Hannah Arendt
To be free in an age like ours, one must be in a position of authority. That in itself would be enough to make me ambitious.::Hannah Arendt
Poets are the only people to whom love is not only a crucial, but an indispensable experience, which entitles them to mistake it for a universal one.::Hannah Arendt
By its very nature the beautiful is isolated from everything else. From beauty no road leads to reality.::Hannah Arendt
The trouble with lying and deceiving is that their efficiency depends entirely upon a clear notion of the truth that the liar and deceiver wishes to hide.::Hannah Arendt
In order to go on living one must try to escape the death involved in perfectionism.::Hannah Arendt
No punishment has ever possessed enough power of deterrence to prevent the commission of crimes. On the contrary, whatever the punishment, once a specific crime has appeared for the first time, its reappearance is more likely than its initial emergence could ever have been.::Hannah Arendt
Forgiveness is the key to action and freedom.::Hannah Arendt
Economic growth may one day turn out to be a curse rather than a good, and under no conditions can it either lead into freedom or constitute a proof for its existence.::Hannah Arendt
The ultimate end of human acts is eudaimonia, happiness in the sense of living well, which all men desire all acts are but different means chosen to arrive at it.::Hannah Arendt
It is in the very nature of things human that every act that has once made its appearance and has been recorded in the history of mankind stays with mankind as a potentiality long after its actuality has become a thing of the past.::Hannah Arendt
This is the precept by which I have lived: Prepare for the worst expect the best and take what comes.::Hannah Arendt
Promises are the uniquely human way of ordering the future, making it predictable and reliable to the extent that this is humanly possible.::Hannah Arendt
Man cannot be free if he does not know that he is subject to necessity, because his freedom is always won in his never wholly successful attempts to liberate himself from necessity.::Hannah Arendt
Forgiveness is the economy of the heart... forgiveness saves the expense of anger, the cost of hatred, the waste of spirits.::Hannah More
Genius without religion is only a lamp on the outer gate of a palace it may serve to cast a gleam of light on those that are without, while the inhabitant sits in darkness.::Hannah More
If faith produce no works, I see That faith is not a living tree. Thus faith and works together grow, No separate life they never can know. They're soul and body, hand and heart, What God hath joined, let no man part.::Hannah More
In Germany I am not so famous.::Hans Berger
I found it peculiar that those who wanted to take military action could - with 100 per cent certainty - know that the weapons existed and turn out to have zero knowledge of where they were.::Hans Blix
Just living is not enough. One must have sunshine, freedom, and a little flower.::Hans Christian Andersen
Travelling expands the mind rarely.::Hans Christian Andersen
Where words fail, music speaks.::Hans Christian Andersen
If the truth contradicts deeply held beliefs, that is too bad.::Hans Eysenck
In our tabulation of psychoanalytic results, we have classed those who stopped treatment together with those not improved. This appears to be reasonable a patient who fails to finish his treatment, and is not improved, is surely a therapeutic failure.::Hans Eysenck
Tact and diplomacy are fine in international relations, in politics, perhaps even in business in science only one thing matters, and that is the facts.::Hans Eysenck
I worked as a lawyer as a member of the teaching staff of a technical college and then I worked principally as legal adviser to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist German Workers Party.::Hans Frank
I dealt with legal questions in the interest of Adolf Hitler and the NSDAP and its members during the difficult years of struggle for the victory of the Movement.::Hans Frank
It was also my idea that the advisory committees of the Academy should replace the legal committees of the German Reichstag, which was gradually fading into the background in the Reich.::Hans Frank
The ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak.::Hans Hofmann
Art cannot result from sophisticated, frivolous, or superficial effects.::Hans Hofmann
Color is a plastic means of creating intervals... color harmonics produced by special relationships, or tensions. We differentiate now between formal tensions and color tensions, just as we differentiate in music between counterpoint and harmony.::Hans Hofmann
Man should not try to avoid stress any more than he would shun food, love or exercise.::Hans Selye
Adopting the right attitude can convert a negative stress into a positive one.::Hans Selye
Even if a unity of faith is not possible, a unity of love is.::Hans Urs von Balthasar
Whoever removes the Cross and its interpretation by the New Testament from the center, in order to replace it, for example, with the social commitment of Jesus to the oppressed as a new center, no longer stands in continuity with the apostolic faith.::Hans Urs von Balthasar
To be sure, the response of faith to revelation, which God grants to the creature he chooses and moves with his love, occurs in such a way that it is truly the creature that provides the response, with its own nature and its natural powers of love.::Hans Urs von Balthasar
Not longer loved or fostered by religion, beauty is lifted from its face as a mask, and its absence exposes features on that face which threaten to become incomprehensible to man.::Hans Urs von Balthasar
We no longer dare to believe in beauty and we make of it a mere appearance in order the more easily to dispose of it.::Hans Urs von Balthasar
But the issue is not only life and death but our existence before God and our being judged by him. All of us were sinners before him and worthy of condemnation.::Hans Urs von Balthasar
It is, finally, a word is untimely in three different senses, and bearing it as one's treasure will not win one anyone's favours one rather risks finding oneself outside everyone's camp... Beauty is the word that shall be our first.::Hans Urs von Balthasar
Beauty is the disinterested one, without which the ancient world refused to understand itself, a word which both imperceptibly and yet unmistakably has bid farewell to our new world, a world of interests, leaving it to its own avarice and sadness.::Hans Urs von Balthasar
Our situation today shows that beauty demands for itself at least as much courage and decision as do truth and goodness, and she will not allow herself to be separated and banned from her two sisters without taking them along with herself in an act of mysterious vengeance.::Hans Urs von Balthasar
Long before we understand ourselves through the process of self-examination, we understand ourselves in a self-evident way in the family, society and state in which we live.::Hans-Georg Gadamer
It was clear to me that the forms of consciousness of our inherited and acquired historical education - aesthetic consciousness and historical consciousness - presented alienated forms of our true historical being.::Hans-Georg Gadamer
In fact history does not belong to us but we belong to it.::Hans-Georg Gadamer
Country music is three chords and the truth.::Harlan Howard
My father used to play with my brother and me in the yard. Mother would come out and say, 'You're tearing up the grass' 'We're not raising grass,' Dad would reply. 'We're raising boys.'::Harmon Killebrew
What we call a poem is mostly what is not there on the page. The strength of any poem is the poems that it has managed to exclude.::Harold Bloom
We read deeply for varied reasons, most of them familiar: that we cannot know enough people profoundly enough that we need to know ourselves better that we require knowledge, not just of self and others, but of the way things are.::Harold Bloom
I would say that there is no future for literary studies as such in the United States.::Harold Bloom
The second, and I think this is the much more overt and I think it is the main cause, I have been increasingly demonstrating or trying to demonstrate that every possible stance a critic, a scholar, a teacher can take towards a poem is itself inevitably and necessarily poetic.::Harold Bloom
But in the end, in the end one is alone. We are all of us alone. I mean I'm told these days we have to consider ourselves as being in society... but in the end one knows one is alone, that one lives at the heart of a solitude.::Harold Bloom
Criticism in the universities, I'll have to admit, has entered a phase where I am totally out of sympathy with 95% of what goes on. It's Stalinism without Stalin.::Harold Bloom

When I was confronted with official tuition, the academic thing, I could see no relationship whatever between that and the music I'd been writing since I was 11.::Harrison Birtwistle
Here, class attendance is expected and students are required to take notes, which they are tested on. What is missing, it seems to me, is the use of knowledge, the practical training.::Harrison Salisbury
I think it's important to travel around in order to get a notion of what's going on, to find out what people are think about. I enjoy talking on campuses most because people are more informed and discussion is generally livelier.::Harrison Salisbury

You owe it to yourself to be the best person possible. Because if you are, others will want to be with you, want to provide you with the things you want in exchange for what you're giving to them.::Harry Browne
I'm old enough to remember the end of World War II. On Aug. 14, 1946, a year after the Japanese were defeated, most newspapers and magazines had single articles commemorating the end of the war.::Harry Browne
World War II has always been of great interest to me. I've known for decades that it was just one more war the politicians suckered us into.::Harry Browne
The communitarians may say you've been enjoying too much individual freedom, and that you must give up some of that for the benefit of the community. But they really mean that they want more power over your life - to force you to subsidize, obey and conform to their choices.::Harry Browne
Each person is living for himself his own happiness is all he can ever personally feel.::Harry Browne
Like many people, most Libertarians feel empathy and sympathy for less fortunate people. But they know you can't have perfection in a world of limited resources.::Harry Browne
Government is force, pure and simple. There's no way to sugar-coat that. And because government is force, it will attract the worst elements of society - people who want to use government to avoid having to earn their living and to avoid having to persuade others to accept their ideas voluntarily.::Harry Browne
Libertarians know that a free country has nothing to fear from anyone coming in or going out - while a welfare state is scared to death of poor people coming in and rich people getting out.::Harry Browne

You don't need an explanation for everything, Recognize that there are such things as miracles - events for which there are no ready explanations. Later knowledge may explain those events quite easily.::Harry Browne
I found that I was getting a warm reception for my message of freeing you from the income tax, releasing you from Social Security, ending the insane war on drugs, restoring gun rights, and reducing the federal government to just its constitutional functions.::Harry Browne

My professional life has been a constant record of disillusion, and many things that seem wonderful to most men are the every-day commonplaces of my business.::Harry Houdini
Aye, I'm tellin' ye, happiness is one of the few things in this world that doubles every time you share it with someone else.::Harry Lauder
Well, the great thing for me about poetry is that in good poems the dislocation of words, that is to say, the distance between what they say they're saying and what they are actually saying is at its greatest.::Harry Mathews
My next project is to get back to that. Actually, to learn how to write poetry. I'm not kidding.::Harry Mathews
Well, my relationship to America at the time I left was very limited.::Harry Mathews
Well, I had this little notion - I started writing when I was eleven, writing poetry. I was passionately addicted to it it was my great refuge through adolescence.::Harry Mathews

It has been my honor to support and work with President Barack Obama, a man who has brought courage and character to the presidency. President Obama's strength of character leads him to do the right thing, even when it isn't the easy thing.::Harry Reid
I was born and raised in the high desert of Nevada in a tiny town called Searchlight. My dad was a hard rock miner. My mom took in wash. I grew up around people of strong values - even if they rarely talked about them.::Harry Reid

Nixon is one of the few in the history of this country to run for high office talking out of both sides of his mouth at the same time and lying out of both sides.::Harry S. Truman
Richard Nixon is a no good, lying bastard. He can lie out of both sides of his mouth at the same time, and if he ever caught himself telling the truth, he'd lie just to keep his hand in.::Harry S. Truman

Be good. Do good. The devil wields no power over a good man.::Harry Segall
Good design doesn't date.::Harry Seidler
The Romans were not inventors of the supporting arch, but its extended use in vaults and intersecting barrel shapes and domes is theirs.::Harry Seidler
After World War II great strides were made in modern Japanese architecture, not only in advanced technology, allowing earthquake resistant tall buildings, but expressing and infusing characteristics of traditional Japanese architecture in modern buildings.::Harry Seidler
Architecture is not an inspirational business, it's a rational procedure to do sensible and hopefully beautiful things that's all.::Harry Seidler
After about the first Millennium, Italy was the cradle of Romanesque architecture, which spread throughout Europe, much of it extending the structural daring with minimal visual elaboration.::Harry Seidler

Don't play too much golf. Two rounds a day are plenty.::Harry Vardon
As a designer, the mission with which we have been charged is simple: providing space at the right cost.::Harry von Zell
The fact that The Bridge contains folk lore and other material suitable to the epic form need not therefore prove its failure as a long lyric poem, with interrelated sections.::Hart Crane
And inasmuch as the bridge is a symbol of all such poetry as I am interested in writing it is my present fancy that a year from now I'll be more contented working in an office than ever before.::Hart Crane
It has taken a great deal of energy, which has not been so difficult to summon as the necessary patience to wait, simply wait much of the time - until my instincts assured me that I had assembled my materials in proper order for a final welding into their natural form.::Hart Crane
I made a circle with a smile for a mouth on yellow paper, because it was sunshiny and bright.::Harvey Ball

You're working on being a father, so that is something that when you experience it you'll understand the profundity of wanting to protect something dear to you.::Harvey Keitel

They say it's good but I didn't know what I was doing until I got into the suit and they put the moustache on me, and somehow, when I got all the drag on, it came out. It was the most amazing thing. I'm truly extraordinary.::Harvey Korman
And I went to New York and died for 10 years I walked those pavements. I can't think of New York without feeling uncomfortable and feeling like a failure.::Harvey Korman
The fact is that more people have been slaughtered in the name of religion than for any other single reason. That, THAT my friends, is true perversion.::Harvey Milk
Hope will never be silent.::Harvey Milk
It takes no compromising to give people their rights. It takes no money to respect the individual. It takes no survey to remove repressions.::Harvey Milk
More people have been slaughtered in the name of religion than for any other single reason. That, my friends, that is true perversion.::Harvey Milk
I wake up every morning in a cold sweat, regardless of how well things went the day before. And put that I said that in a somewhat but not completely tongue-in-cheek way.::Harvey Pekar
You can find heroism everyday, like guys working terrible jobs because they've got to support their families. Or as far as humor, the things I see on the job, on the street, are far funnier than anything you'll ever see on TV.::Harvey Pekar

It has always been difficult for Man to realize that his life is all an art. It has been more difficult to conceive it so than to act it so. For that is always how he has more or less acted it.::Havelock Ellis
Jealousy, that dragon which slays love under the pretence of keeping it alive.::Havelock Ellis
Dreams are real as long as they last. Can we say more of life?::Havelock Ellis

The sanitary and mechanical age we are now entering makes up for the mercy it grants to our sense of smell by the ferocity with which it assails our sense of hearing.::Havelock Ellis
There is a very intimate connection between hypnotic phenomena and religion.::Havelock Ellis
All the art of living lies in a fine mingling of letting go and holding on.::Havelock Ellis
The art of dancing stands at the source of all the arts that express themselves first in the human person. The art of building, or architecture, is the beginning of all the arts that lie outside the person and in the end they unite.::Havelock Ellis
It is on our failures that we base a new and different and better success.::Havelock Ellis
If men and women are to understand each other, to enter into each other's nature with mutual sympathy, and to become capable of genuine comradeship, the foundation must be laid in youth.::Havelock Ellis
It is becoming clear that the old platitudes can no longer be maintained, and that if we wish to improve our morals we must first improve our knowledge.::Havelock Ellis
For every fresh stage in our lives we need a fresh education, and there is no stage for which so little educational preparation is made as that which follows the reproductive period.::Havelock Ellis
Men who know themselves are no longer fools. They stand on the threshold of the door of Wisdom.::Havelock Ellis
Man lives by imagination.::Havelock Ellis
There is nothing that war has ever achieved that we could not better achieve without it.::Havelock Ellis
The sun, the moon and the stars would have disappeared long ago... had they happened to be within the reach of predatory human hands.::Havelock Ellis
The average husband enjoys the total effect of his home but is usually unable to contribute any of the details of work and organisation that make it enjoyable.::Havelock Ellis
Thinking in its lower grades, is comparable to paper money, and in its higher forms it is a kind of poetry.::Havelock Ellis
The romantic embrace can only be compared with music and with prayer.::Havelock Ellis
I always seem to have a vague feeling that he is a Satan among musicians, a fallen angel in the darkness who is perpetually seeking to fight his way back to happiness.::Havelock Ellis
In the early days of Christianity the exercise of chastity was frequently combined with a close and romantic intimacy of affection between the sexes which shocked austere moralists.::Havelock Ellis
'Charm' - which means the power to effect work without employing brute force - is indispensable to women. Charm is a woman's strength just as strength is a man's charm.::Havelock Ellis
The people who run a university are far more qualified and intelligent in handling people than someone who inherited his money and used it to buy a pro team.::Hayden Fry
I wanted the players to feel like they were part of a family, to be conscious of that controlled togetherness as they made that slow entrance onto the field. It had a great psychological effect on the opposing team, too. They'd never seen anything like it.::Hayden Fry
I'll be here in my home with three big screens. I'll be watching three games at a time, and when they're over, I'll look at three more.::Hayden Fry
At least I have the modesty to admit that lack of modesty is one of my failings.::Hector Berlioz
Love cannot express the idea of music, while music may give an idea of love.::Hector Berlioz
Time is a great teacher, but unfortunately it kills all its pupils.::Hector Berlioz
Analysis gave me great freedom of emotions and fantastic confidence. I felt I had served my time as a puppet.::Hedy Lamarr
The ceremony took six minutes. The marriage lasted about the same amount of time though we didn't get a divorce for almost a year.::Hedy Lamarr
Mr. DeMille's theory of sexual difference was that marriage is an artificial state for women. The want to be taken, ruled, raped. That was his theory.::Hedy Lamarr
The ladder of success in Hollywood is usually a press agent, actor, director, producer, leading man and you are a star if you sleep with each of them in that order. Crude, but true.::Hedy Lamarr
I don't fear death because I don't fear anything I don't understand. When I start to think about it, I order a massage and it goes away.::Hedy Lamarr
Any girl can be glamorous. All you have to do is stand still and look stupid.::Hedy Lamarr
Some men like a dull life - they like the routine of eating breakfast, going to work, coming home, petting the dog, watching TV, kissing the kids, and going to bed. Stay clear of it - it's often catching.::Hedy Lamarr
I have not been that wise. Health I have taken for granted. Love I have demanded, perhaps too much and too often. As for money, I have only realized its true worth when I didn't have it.::Hedy Lamarr
It is easier for women to succeed in business, the arts, and politics in America than in Europe.::Hedy Lamarr
I have never seen a wrestling match or a prize fight, and I don't want to. When I find out a man is interested in these sports, I drop him.::Hedy Lamarr
I advise everybody not to save: spend your money. Most people save all their lives and leave it to somebody else. Money is to be enjoyed.::Hedy Lamarr
If you use your imagination, you can look at any actress and see her nude... I hope to make you use your imagination.::Hedy Lamarr
Dates with actors, finally, just seemed to me evenings of shop talk. I got sick of it after a hile. So the more famous I became, the more I narrowed down my choices.::Hedy Lamarr
My mother always called me an ugly weed, so I never was aware of anything until I was older. Plain girls should have someone telling them they are beautiful. Sometimes this works miracles.::Hedy Lamarr
I don't believe in life after death. But I do believe in some grinding destiny that watches over us on earth. If I didn't, the safety valve would give and the boiler would explode.::Hedy Lamarr
A good painting to me has always been like a friend. It keeps me company, comforts and inspires.::Hedy Lamarr
I am not ashamed to say that no man I ever met was my father's equal, and I never loved any other man as much.::Hedy Lamarr
American men, as a group, seem to be interested in only two things, money and breasts. It seems a very narrow outlook.::Hedy Lamarr
Confidence is something you're born with. I know I had loads of it even at the age of 15.::Hedy Lamarr
It's funny about men and women. Men pay in cash to get them and pay in cash to get rid of them. Women pay emotionally coming and going. Neither has it easy.::Hedy Lamarr

There are in fact two things, science and opinion the former begets knowledge, the later ignorance.::Hippocrates
Healing is a matter of time, but it is sometimes also a matter of opportunity.::Hippocrates
Everything in excess is opposed to nature.::Hippocrates
I have studied many philosophers and many cats. The wisdom of cats is infinitely superior.::Hippolyte Taine
The first casualty when war comes is truth.::Hiram Johnson
The equality among all members of the League, which is provided in the statutes giving each state only one vote, cannot of course abolish the actual material inequality of the powers concerned.::Hjalmar Branting
A formally recognized equality does, however, accord the smaller nations a position which they should be able to use increasingly in the interest of humanity as a whole and in the service of the ideal.::Hjalmar Branting
But what you could perhaps do with in these days is a word of most sincere sympathy. Your movement is carried internally by so strong a truth and necessity that victory in one form or another cannot elude you for long.::Hjalmar Schacht
The economy is a very sensitive organism.::Hjalmar Schacht
The object of my relationship with Vietnam has been to heal the wounds that exist, particularly among our veterans, and to move forward with a positive relationship,... Apparently some in the Vietnamese government don't want to do that and that's their decision.::Ho Chi Minh
You can kill ten of our men for every one we kill of yours. But even at those odds, you will lose and we will win.::Ho Chi Minh
The Vietnamese people deeply love independence, freedom and peace. But in the face of United States aggression they have risen up, united as one man.::Ho Chi Minh
It was patriotism, not communism, that inspired me.::Ho Chi Minh
Remember, the storm is a good opportunity for the pine and the cypress to show their strength and their stability.::Ho Chi Minh
There are only two lasting bequests we can hope to give our children. One of these is roots, the other, wings.::Hodding Carter
The time to read is any time: no apparatus, no appointment of time and place, is necessary. It is the only art which can be practiced at any hour of the day or night, whenever the time and inclination comes, that is your time for reading in joy or sorrow, health or illness.::Holbrook Jackson
No man is ever old enough to know better.::Holbrook Jackson
Genius is initiative on fire.::Holbrook Jackson
Patience has its limits, take it too far and it's cowardice.::Holbrook Jackson
Those who seek happiness miss it, and those who discuss it, lack it.::Holbrook Jackson
To have a great man for an intimate friend seems pleasant to those who have never tried it those who have, fear it.::Homer
The difficulty is not so great to die for a friend, as to find a friend worth dying for.::Homer
But curb thou the high spirit in thy breast, for gentle ways are best, and keep aloof from sharp contentions.::Homer
There is nothing nobler or more admirable than when two people who see eye to eye keep house as man and wife, confounding their enemies and delighting their friends.::Homer
Words empty as the wind are best left unsaid.::Homer
And what he greatly thought, he nobly dared.::Homer
Yet, taught by time, my heart has learned to glow for other's good, and melt at other's woe.::Homer
In youth and beauty, wisdom is but rare!::Homer

Lawyers are men who hire out their words and anger.::Horace
Seize the day, and put the least possible trust in tomorrow.::Horace
Remember when life's path is steep to keep your mind even.::Horace
Great effort is required to arrest decay and restore vigor. One must exercise proper deliberation, plan carefully before making a move, and be alert in guarding against relapse following a renaissance.::Horace
Knowledge without education is but armed injustice.::Horace
It is no great art to say something briefly when, like Tacitus, one has something to say when one has nothing to say, however, and none the less writes a whole book and makes truth into a liar - that I call an achievement.::Horace
Suffering is but another name for the teaching of experience, which is the parent of instruction and the schoolmaster of life.::Horace
Wisdom is not wisdom when it is derived from books alone.::Horace
Strange - is it not? That of the myriads who Before us passed the door of Darkness through, Not one returns to tell us of the road Which to discover we must travel too.::Horace
Undeservedly you will atone for the sins of your fathers.::Horace
Sad people dislike the happy, and the happy the sad the quick thinking the sedate, and the careless the busy and industrious.::Horace
Few cross the river of time and are able to reach non-being. Most of them run up and down only on this side of the river. But those who when they know the law follow the path of the law, they shall reach the other shore and go beyond the realm of death.::Horace
Money is a handmaiden, if thou knowest how to use it a mistress, if thou knowest not.::Horace

Anger is a short madness.::Horace
A heart well prepared for adversity in bad times hopes, and in good times fears for a change in fortune.::Horace
The power of daring anything their fancy suggest, as always been conceded to the painter and the poet.::Horace
No poems can please for long or live that are written by water drinkers.::Horace
To have a great man for a friend seems pleasant to those who have never tried it those who have, fear it.::Horace
The darkest hour in any man's life is when he sits down to plan how to get money without earning it.::Horace Greeley
Education alone can conduct us to that enjoyment which is, at once, best in quality and infinite in quantity.::Horace Mann
Every addition to true knowledge is an addition to human power.::Horace Mann
A human being is not attaining his full heights until he is educated.::Horace Mann
Education is our only political safety. Outside of this ark all is deluge.::Horace Mann
The teacher who is attempting to teach without inspiring the pupil with a desire to learn is hammering on cold iron.::Horace Mann
When a child can be brought to tears, and not from fear of punishment, but from repentance he needs no chastisement. When the tears begin to flow from the grief of their conduct you can be sure there is an angel nestling in their heart.::Horace Mann
A teacher who is attempting to teach without inspiring the pupil with a desire to learn is hammering on cold iron.::Horace Mann
Unfaithfulness in the keeping of an appointment is an act of clear dishonesty. You may as well borrow a person's money as his time.::Horace Mann
To pity distress is but human to relieve it is Godlike.::Horace Mann
Scientific truth is marvelous, but moral truth is divine and whoever breathes its air and walks by its light has found the lost paradise.::Horace Mann
Seek not greatness, but seek truth and you will find both.::Horace Mann
Generosity during life is a very different thing from generosity in the hour of death one proceeds from genuine liberality and benevolence, the other from pride or fear.::Horace Mann
Education then, beyond all other devices of human origin, is the great equalizer of the conditions of men, the balance-wheel of the social machinery.::Horace Mann
If any man seeks for greatness, let him forget greatness and ask for truth, and he will find both.::Horace Mann
Oh, the ignorance of us upon whom Providence did not sufficiently smile to permit us to be born in New England.::Horace Porter
Alexander at the head of the world never tasted the true pleasure that boys of his own age have enjoyed at the head of a school.::Horace Walpole
Poetry is a beautiful way of spoiling prose, and the laborious art of exchanging plain sense for harmony.::Horace Walpole
By deafness one gains in one respect more than one loses one misses more nonsense than sense.::Horace Walpole
Justice is rather the activity of truth, than a virtue in itself. Truth tells us what is due to others, and justice renders that due. Injustice is acting a lie.::Horace Walpole
The whole secret of life is to be interested in one thing profoundly and in a thousand things well.::Horace Walpole
I avoid talking before the youth of the age as I would dancing before them: for if one's tongue don't move in the steps of the day, and thinks to please by its old graces, it is only an object of ridicule.::Horace Walpole
Imagination was given to man to compensate him for what he isn't. A sense of humor was provided to console him for what he is.::Horace Walpole
Plot, rules, nor even poetry, are not half so great beauties in tragedy or comedy as a just imitation of nature, of character, of the passions and their operations in diversified situations.::Horace Walpole
The institution of chivalry forms one of the most remarkable features in the history of the Middle Ages.::Horatio Alger
No period of my life has been one of such unmixed happiness as the four years which have been spent within college walls.::Horatio Alger
Citizens, the priority now is to recover trust between the Egyptian - amongst the Egyptians and to have trust and confidence in our economy and international reputation and the fact that the change that we have embarked on will carry on and there's no going back to the old days.::Hosni Mubarak
I intend to travel to Okinawa and to visit with Okinawa officials and the citizens of Okinawa at an early date. I will send my best analysis of that situation, including the local attitudes, back to Washington, to the government there.::Howard Baker
We were astonished by the beauty and refinement of the art displayed by the objects surpassing all we could have imagined - the impression was overwhelming.::Howard Carter
I look forward to working with our leadership team to advance the causes of smaller government, lower taxes, eliminating terrorism, and providing affordable health care, among other issues.::Howard Coble
My home State of North Carolina ranks 12th in the United States for increased aging population and, according to a national report, 41st in overall health. According to this same report, individuals aged 50+ are the least healthy.::Howard Coble
After all, is football a game or a religion?::Howard Cosell
Then there is a still higher type of courage - the courage to brave pain, to live with it, to never let others know of it and to still find joy in life to wake up in the morning with an enthusiasm for the day ahead.::Howard Cosell
The importance that our society attaches to sport is incredible. After all, is football a game or a religion? The people of this country have allowed sports to get completely out of hand.::Howard Cosell
Sports is human life in microcosm.::Howard Cosell
The ultimate victory in competition is derived from the inner satisfaction of knowing that you have done your best and that you have gotten the most out of what you had to give.::Howard Cosell
Sports is the toy department of human life.::Howard Cosell
Composers shouldn't think too much - it interferes with their plagiarism.::Howard Dietz
I'm vulnerable to criticism. Any artist is, because you work alone in your studio and, until recently, critics were the only way you'd get any feedback.::Howard Hodgkin
Money can't buy happiness.::Howard Hughes
I shall give you hunger, and pain, and sleepless nights. Also beauty, and satisfactions known to few, and glimpses of the heavenly life. None of these you shall have continually, and of their coming and going you shall not be foretold.::Howard Lindsay
I've never read a political poem that's accomplished anything. Poetry makes things happen, but rarely what the poet wants.::Howard Nemerov
I sometimes talk about the making of a poem within the poem.::Howard Nemerov
I think there was a revolution in poetry, associated chiefly with Eliot and Pound but maybe it is of the nature of revolutions or of the nature of history that their innovations should later come to look trivial or indistinguishable from technical tricks.::Howard Nemerov
I would talk in iambic pentameter if it were easier.::Howard Nemerov
History is one of those marvelous and necessary illusions we have to deal with. It's one of the ways of dealing with our world with impossible generalities which we couldn't live without.::Howard Nemerov
I do insist on making what I hope is sense so there's always a coherent narrative or argument that the reader can follow.::Howard Nemerov
For a Jewish Puritan of the middle class, the novel is serious, the novel is work, the novel is conscientious application why, the novel is practically the retail business all over again.::Howard Nemerov
Nothing in the universe can travel at the speed of light, they say, forgetful of the shadow's speed.::Howard Nemerov
I never abandoned either forms or freedom. I imagine that most of what could be called free verse is in my first book. I got through that fairly early.::Howard Nemerov
The nice thing about the Bible is it doesn't give you too many facts. Two an a half lines and it tells you the whole story and that leaves you a great deal of freedom to elaborate on how it might have happened.::Howard Nemerov
The secrets of success are a good wife and a steady job. My wife told me.::Howard Nemerov
A chronicle is very different from history proper.::Howard Nemerov
A teacher is a person who never says anything once.::Howard Nemerov
A lot happens by accident in poetry.::Howard Nemerov
If either player abandon the game by quitting the table in anger, or in an otherwise offensive manner or by momentarily resigning the game or refuses to abide by the decision of the Umpire, the game must be scored against him.::Howard Staunton
Commitment means that it is possible for a man to yield the nerve center of his consent to a purpose or cause, a movement or an ideal, which may be more important to him than whether he lives or dies.::Howard Thurman
During times of war, hatred becomes quite respectable even though it has to masquerade often under the guise of patriotism.::Howard Thurman
War itself is the enemy of the human race.::Howard Zinn
One certain effect of war is to diminish freedom of expression.::Howard Zinn
Dissent is the highest form of patriotism.::Howard Zinn
We need to decide that we will not go to war, whatever reason is conjured up by the politicians or the media, because war in our time is always indiscriminate, a war against innocents, a war against children.::Howard Zinn
If those in charge of our society - politicians, corporate executives, and owners of press and television - can dominate our ideas, they will be secure in their power. They will not need soldiers patrolling the streets. We will control ourselves.::Howard Zinn
When people don't understand that the government doesn't have their interests in mind, they're more susceptible to go to war.::Howard Zinn
Life and human society are the chief concern of Confucianism and, through it, the chief concern of the Chinese people.::Hu Shih
No student of Chinese history can say that the Chinese are incapable of religious experience, even when judged by the standards of medieval Europe or pious India.::Hu Shih
After learning the language and culture of the Chinese people, these Jesuits began to establish contacts with the young intellectuals of the country.::Hu Shih
What is sacred among one people may be ridiculous in another and what is despised or rejected by one cultural group, may in a different environment become the cornerstone for a great edifice of strange grandeur and beauty.::Hu Shih
On the basis of biological, sociological, and historical knowledge, we should recognize that the individual self is subject to death or decay, but the sum total of individual achievement, for better or worse, lives on in the immortality of The Larger.::Hu Shih
On July 26, 1916, I announced to all my friends in America that from now on I resolved to write no more poems in the classical language, and to begin my experiments in writing poetry in the so-called vulgar tongue of the people.::Hu Shih
Another important historical factor is the fact that this already very simple religion was further simplified and purified by the early philosophers of ancient China. Our first great philosopher was a founder of naturalism and our second great philosopher was an agnostic.::Hu Shih
Only when we realize that there is no eternal, unchanging truth or absolute truth can we arouse in ourselves a sense of intellectual responsibility.::Hu Shih
Exercise is the chief source of improvement in our faculties.::Hugh Blair
The difference between Marilyn Monroe and the early Pamela Anderson is not that great. What's amazing is that the taste of American men and international tastes in terms of beauty have essentially stayed the same. Styles change, but our view of beauty stays the same.::Hugh Hefner
My folks were raised pure prohibitionist. They were very good people, with high moral standards - but very repressed. There was no hugging and kissing in my home.::Hugh Hefner
I always say now that I'm in my blonde years. Because since the end of my marriage, all of my girlfriends have been blonde.::Hugh Hefner
I am in very good health. I've never felt better.::Hugh Hefner
I'm very comfortable with the nature of life and death, and that we come to an end. What's most difficult to imagine is that those dreams and early yearnings and desires of childhood and adolescence will also disappear. But who knows? Maybe you become part of the eternal whatever.::Hugh Hefner
If you let society and your peers define who you are, you're the less for it.::Hugh Hefner
In my wildest dreams, I could not have imagined a sweeter life.::Hugh Hefner
The major civilizing force in the world is not religion, it is sex.::Hugh Hefner
I was very influenced by the musicals and romantic comedies of the 1930s. I admired Gene Harlow and such, which probably explains why, since the end of my marriage, I've dated nothing but a succession of blondes.::Hugh Hefner
My life is every moment of my life. It is not a culmination of the past.::Hugh Leonard
My father I liked, but it was only after his death that I got to know him by writing the play.::Hugh Leonard
My mother was passionate. She was stubborn, the dominant one in the family. She dominated my father.::Hugh Leonard
I went through life like an idiot for a great deal of the time, saying there's nothing I would change. That was a very arrogant thing to say. There's a lot I would change. There are people I would have steered clear of.::Hugh Leonard
A sense of humor... is needed armor. Joy in one's heart and some laughter on one's lips is a sign that the person down deep has a pretty good grasp of life.::Hugh Sidey
The legions of reporters who cover politics don't want to quit the clash and thunder of electoral combat for the dry duty of analyzing the federal budget. As a consequence, we have created the perpetual presidential campaign.::Hugh Sidey
Happiness comes from... some curious adjustment to life.::Hugh Walpole
In all science, error precedes the truth, and it is better it should go first than last.::Hugh Walpole
When I was 40, my doctor advised me that a man in his 40s shouldn't play tennis. I heeded his advice carefully and could hardly wait until I reached 50 to start again.::Hugo Black
It is the paradox of life that the way to miss pleasure is to seek it first. The very first condition of lasting happiness is that a life should be full of purpose, aiming at something outside self.::Hugo Black
The Framers of the Constitution knew that free speech is the friend of change and revolution. But they also knew that it is always the deadliest enemy of tyranny.::Hugo Black
Criticism of government finds sanctuary in several portions of the 1st Amendment. It is part of the right of free speech. It embraces freedom of the press.::Hugo Black
In my view, far from deserving condemnation for their courageous reporting, the New York Times, the Washington Post and other newspapers should be commended for serving the purpose that the Founding Fathers saw so clearly.::Hugo Black
For me, my travels have been the chance to go to a place that already exists in my imagination.::Hugo Pratt
He's dreaming with his eyes open, and those that dream with their eyes open are dangerous, for they do not know when their dreams come to an end.::Hugo Pratt
If you wish to spare yourself and your venerable family, give heed to my advice with the ear of intelligence. If you do not, you will see what God has willed.::Hulagu Khan
The whole business of marshaling one's energies becomes more and more important as one grows older.::Hume Cronyn
The only point in making money is, you can tell some big shot where to go.::Humphrey Bogart
In the present state of our knowledge, it would be useless to attempt to speculate on the remote cause of the electrical energy... its relation to chemical affinity is, however, sufficiently evident. May it not be identical with it, and an essential property of matter?::Humphry Davy
Life is made up, not of great sacrifices or duties, but of little things, in which smiles and kindness, and small obligations given habitually, are what preserve the heart and secure comfort.::Humphry Davy
The most important of my discoveries have been suggested to me by my failures.::Humphry Davy
In a closed society where everybody's guilty, the only crime is getting caught. In a world of thieves, the only final sin is stupidity.::Hunter S. Thompson
No man is so foolish but he may sometimes give another good counsel, and no man so wise that he may not easily err if he takes no other counsel than his own. He that is taught only by himself has a fool for a master.::Hunter S. Thompson
The TV business is uglier than most things. It is normally perceived as some kind of cruel and shallow money trench through the heart of the journalism industry, a long plastic hallway where thieves and pimps run free and good men die like dogs, for no good reason.::Hunter S. Thompson
It was the Law of the Sea, they said. Civilization ends at the waterline. Beyond that, we all enter the food chain, and not always right at the top.::Hunter S. Thompson
The person who doesn't scatter the morning dew will not comb gray hairs.::Hunter S. Thompson
America... just a nation of two hundred million used car salesmen with all the money we need to buy guns and no qualms about killing anybody else in the world who tries to make us uncomfortable.::Hunter S. Thompson
Politics is the art of controlling your environment.::Hunter S. Thompson
I have a theory that the truth is never told during the nine-to-five hours.::Hunter S. Thompson
Of all the men that have run for president in the twentieth century, only George McGovern truly understood what a monument America could be to the human race.::Hunter S. Thompson
If I'd written all the truth I knew for the past ten years, about 600 people - including me - would be rotting in prison cells from Rio to Seattle today. Absolute truth is a very rare and dangerous commodity in the context of professional journalism.::Hunter S. Thompson
The trouble with Nixon is that he's a serious politics junkie. He's totally hooked and like any other junkie, he's a bummer to have around, especially as President.::Hunter S. Thompson
For every moment of triumph, for every instance of beauty, many souls must be trampled.::Hunter S. Thompson
When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro.::Hunter S. Thompson
Whether things turn out for the better depends on what we do. We ought not spend our time masterminding the future, but recognize our marching orders: to do the best we can for history and the planet.::Huston Smith
First of all, my persuasion is what really breeds violence is political differences. But because religion serves as the soul of community, it gets drawn into the fracas and turns up the heat.::Huston Smith
The faith I was born into formed me.::Huston Smith
I've spent the last 50 years or so steeping myself in the world's religions, and I've done my homework. I've gone to each of the world's eight great religions and sought out the most profound scholars I could find, and I've apprenticed myself to them and actually practiced each faith.::Huston Smith
Human intelligence is a reflection of the intelligence that produces everything. In knowing, we are simply extending the intelligence that comes to and constitutes us. We mimic the mind of God, so to speak. Or better, we continue and extend it.::Huston Smith
It is commonly said and known that each civilization has its own religion. Now my claim is that if we look deeper, the different civilizations were brought into being by the different revelations.::Huston Smith
Exclusively oral cultures are unencumbered by dead knowledge, dead facts. Libraries, on the other hand, are full of them.::Huston Smith
Religion is the call to confront reality to master the self.::Huston Smith
Poetry is a special use of language that opens onto the real. The business of the poet is truth telling, which is why in the Celtic tradition no one could be a teacher unless he or she was a poet.::Huston Smith
Rationalism and Newtonian science has lured us into dark woods, but a new metaphysics can rescue us.::Huston Smith
Every society and religion has rules, for both have moral laws. And the essence of morality consists, as in art, of drawing the line somewhere.::Huston Smith
In fact men will fight for a superstition quite as quickly as for a living truth - often more so, since a superstition is so intangible you cannot get at it to refute it, but truth is a point of view, and so is changeable.::Hypatia
Fables should be taught as fables, myths as myths, and miracles as poetic fantasies. To teach superstitions as truths is a most terrible thing. The child mind accepts and believes them, and only through great pain and perhaps tragedy can he be in after years relieved of them.::Hypatia
Life is an unfoldment, and the further we travel the more truth we can comprehend. To understand the things that are at our door is the best preparation for understanding those that lie beyond.::Hypatia
You only live twice. Once when you are born and once when you look death in the face.::Ian Fleming
But at the beginning it was clear to me that concrete poetry was peculiarly suited for using in public settings. This was my idea, but of course I never really much got the chance to do it.::Ian Hamilton Finlay
The same sort of thing happened in my dispute with the National Trust book: Follies: A National Trust Guide, which implied that the only pleasure you can get from Folly architecture is by calling the architect mad, and by laughing at the architecture.::Ian Hamilton Finlay
Well, probably I was fed up with concrete poetry. There was a lot of bad concrete poetry and besides, it was confused with visual poetry which was completely different.::Ian Hamilton Finlay
For me concrete poetry was a particular way of using language which came out of a particular feeling, and I don't have control over whether this feeling is in me or not.::Ian Hamilton Finlay
But I can only write what the muse allows me to write. I cannot choose, I can only do what I am given, and I feel pleased when I feel close to concrete poetry - still.::Ian Hamilton Finlay
Freedom. And Justice. If you have those two, it covers everything. You must stick to those principles and have the courage of your convictions.::Ian Smith
I came home every Friday afternoon, riding the six miles on the back of a big mule. I spent Saturday and Sunday washing and ironing and cooking for the children and went back to my country school on Sunday afternoon.::Ida B. Wells
The mob spirit has grown with the increasing intelligence of the Afro-American.::Ida B. Wells
There is no man more dangerous, in a position of power, than he who refuses to accept as a working truth the idea that all a man does should make for rightness and soundness, that even the fixing of a tariff rate must be moral.::Ida Tarbell
Imagination is the only key to the future. Without it none exists - with it all things are possible.::Ida Tarbell
The work of the individual still remains the spark that moves mankind ahead even more than teamwork.::Igor Sikorsky
Film music should have the same relationship to the film drama that somebody's piano playing in my living room has on the book I am reading.::Igor Stravinsky
A plague on eminence! I hardly dare cross the street anymore without a convoy, and I am stared at wherever I go like an idiot member of a royal family or an animal in a zoo and zoo animals have been known to die from stares.::Igor Stravinsky
Lesser artists borrow, great artists steal.::Igor Stravinsky
Is it not by love alone that we succeed in penetrating to the very essence of being?::Igor Stravinsky
The trouble with music appreciation in general is that people are taught to have too much respect for music they should be taught to love it instead.::Igor Stravinsky
I haven't understood a bar of music in my life, but I have felt it.::Igor Stravinsky
I have learned throughout my life as a composer chiefly through my mistakes and pursuits of false assumptions, not by my exposure to founts of wisdom and knowledge.::Igor Stravinsky
Conductors' careers are made for the most part with 'Romantic' music. 'Classic' music eliminates the conductor we do not remember him in it.::Igor Stravinsky
The principle of the endless melody is the perpetual becoming of a music that never had any reason for starting, any more than it has any reason for ending.::Igor Stravinsky
I am in the present. I cannot know what tomorrow will bring forth. I can know only what the truth is for me today. That is what I am called upon to serve, and I serve it in all lucidity.::Igor Stravinsky
Modern medical advances have helped millions of people live longer, healthier lives. We owe these improvements to decades of investment in medical research.::Ike Skelton
The goal of NIH research is to acquire new knowledge to help prevent, detect, diagnose, and treat disease and disability, from the rarest genetic disorder to the common cold.::Ike Skelton
I'm really thankful to God, man. Like now, I'm really making a real comeback with my group. With or without a record, with or without a movie. And behind all the negative press behind this movie.::Ike Turner
They used to say it was bad for Indians to drink, but it's bad for anybody. When they drink they lose their cool, a lot of us. Like when we played with Sonny Boy, I would never get paid, you know. He would drink up all the money.::Ike Turner
Among famous traitors of history one might mention the weather.::Ilka Chase
Wart hogs should sue for libel. It is a terrible name and they are fine fellows and devoted family men and it is rare to see one by himself the little woman and the kiddies are usually close at hand.::Ilka Chase
Life is not a matter of place, things or comfort rather, it concerns the basic human rights of family, country, justice and human dignity.::Imelda Marcos
It is shallow people who think beauty is frivolous or excessive. If you are bringing beauty and god, you are enriching the country. Rice feeds the body, books feed the mind, beauty feeds the soul. It is one thing I can really be proud of and stand tall in the world.::Imelda Marcos
Ferdinand was a gold trader. He was a lawyer for mining companies. When he entered politics in l949, he had tons and tons of gold. When Bill Gates was a college dropout, Ferdinand already possessed billions of dollars and tons of gold. It wasn't stolen.::Imelda Marcos
I have never been a material girl. My father always told me never to love anything that cannot love you back.::Imelda Marcos
I will come up with a project that will wipe out poverty in the Philippines in two years. I want to remove the people from economic crisis by using the Marcos wealth. Long after I'm gone, people will remember me for building them homes and roads and hospitals and giving them food.::Imelda Marcos
I love everybody. One of the great things about me is that I have a very positive attitude.::Imelda Marcos
Filipinos want beauty. I have to look beautiful so that the poor Filipinos will have a star to look at from their slums.::Imelda Marcos
My dreams have become puny with the reality my life has become.::Imelda Marcos
When they see me holding fish, they can see that I am comfortable with kings as well as with paupers.::Imelda Marcos
Filipinos don't wallow in what is miserable and ugly. They recycle the bad into things of beauty.::Imelda Marcos
My dreams were always small and puny. All I ever needed was a little house with a little picket fence by the sea. Little did I know that I would live in Malacanang Palace for 20 years and visit all the major palaces of mankind. And then also meet ordinary citizens and the leaders of superpowers.::Imelda Marcos
They went into my closets looking for skeletons, but thank God, all they found were shoes, beautiful shoes.::Imelda Marcos
I beg Osama to stop warring. He is a Muslim, and Islam means peace. Nobody wins in a war... I wish I were tapped in the problem about Iraq. I knew Saddam enough that I could have talked him into surrendering. But it's too late.::Imelda Marcos
The only rich person is a person who is rich in spirit. I have no money deposit. I have only beauty deposit.::Imelda Marcos
Never dress down for the poor. They won't respect you for it. They want their First Lady to look like a million dollars.::Imelda Marcos
I always say you can never be extravagant with beauty. Beauty is God made real. Beauty is life.::Imelda Marcos
People say I'm extravagant because I want to be surrounded by beauty. But tell me, who wants to be surrounded by garbage?::Imelda Marcos
I did not have three thousand pairs of shoes, I had one thousand and sixty.::Imelda Marcos
The problem of the world today is the people talk on and on about democracy, freedom, justice. But I don't give a damn about democracy if I am worried about survival.::Imelda Marcos
I really had no great love for shoes. I was a working First Lady I was always in canvas shoes. I did nurture the shoes industry of the Philippines, and so every time there was a shoe fair, I would receive a pair of shoes as a token of gratitude.::Imelda Marcos
The Philippines is a terrible name, coming from Spain. Phillip II was the father of the inquisition, who I believe died of syphilis. It is my great regret that we didn't change the name of our country.::Imelda Marcos

All the interests of my reason, speculative as well as practical, combine in the three following questions: 1. What can I know? 2. What ought I to do? 3. What may I hope?::Immanuel Kant
Experience without theory is blind, but theory without experience is mere intellectual play.::Immanuel Kant
Immaturity is the incapacity to use one's intelligence without the guidance of another.::Immanuel Kant
Even philosophers will praise war as ennobling mankind, forgetting the Greek who said: 'War is bad in that it begets more evil than it kills.'::Immanuel Kant
Religion is the recognition of all our duties as divine commands.::Immanuel Kant
But although all our knowledge begins with experience, it does not follow that it arises from experience.::Immanuel Kant
Intuition and concepts constitute... the elements of all our knowledge, so that neither concepts without an intuition in some way corresponding to them, nor intuition without concepts, can yield knowledge.::Immanuel Kant
What can I know? What ought I to do? What can I hope?::Immanuel Kant
He who is cruel to animals becomes hard also in his dealings with men. We can judge the heart of a man by his treatment of animals.::Immanuel Kant

You see, I became kind of a drop-out in science after I came back to America.::Imogen Cunningham
Research programmes, besides their negative heuristic, are also characterized by their positive heuristic.::Imre Lakatos
The positive heuristic of the programme saves the scientist from becoming confused by the ocean of anomalies.::Imre Lakatos
Einstein's results again turned the tables and now very few philosophers or scientists still think that scientific knowledge is, or can be, proven knowledge.::Imre Lakatos
A nation' s strength ultimately consists in what it can do on its own, and not in what it can borrow from others.::Indira Gandhi
My grandfather once told me that there were two kinds of people: those who do the work and those who take the credit. He told me to try to be in the first group there was much less competition.::Indira Gandhi
Anger is never without an argument, but seldom with a good one.::Indira Gandhi
If I die a violent death, as some fear and a few are plotting, I know that the violence will be in the thought and the action of the assassins, not in my dying.::Indira Gandhi
The power to question is the basis of all human progress.::Indira Gandhi
One must beware of ministers who can do nothing without money, and those who want to do everything with money.::Indira Gandhi

Forgiveness is a virtue of the brave.::Indira Gandhi
Yoga is a way to freedom. By its constant practice, we can free ourselves from fear, anguish and loneliness.::Indra Devi
We must keep both our femininity and our strength.::Indra Devi
Film as dream, film as music. No art passes our conscience in the way film does, and goes directly to our feelings, deep down into the dark rooms of our souls.::Ingmar Bergman
I hope I never get so old I get religious.::Ingmar Bergman
I remember one day sitting at the pool and suddenly the tears were streaming down my cheeks. Why was I so unhappy? I had success. I had security. But it wasn't enough. I was exploding inside.::Ingrid Bergman
A kiss is a lovely trick designed by nature to stop speech when words become superfluous.::Ingrid Bergman
Cancer victims who don't accept their fate, who don't learn to live with it, will only destroy what little time they have left.::Ingrid Bergman

Happiness is good health and a bad memory.::Ingrid Bergman
I have grown up alone. I've taken care of myself. I worked, earned money and was independent at 18.::Ingrid Bergman

Ikea people do not drive flashy cars or stay at luxury hotels.::Ingvar Kamprad
Old age adds to the respect due to virtue, but it takes nothing from the contempt inspired by vice it whitens only the hair.::Ira Gershwin
I finally did work out a very good relationship with my father, but it was rough growing up. We had a lot of conflict, and I think it surfaced in many of my works.::Ira Levin
Every man needs two women: a quiet home-maker, and a thrilling nymph.::Iris Murdoch
In almost every marriage there is a selfish and an unselfish partner. A pattern is set up and soon becomes inflexible, of one person always making the demands and one person always giving way.::Iris Murdoch
The cry of equality pulls everyone down.::Iris Murdoch
The priesthood is a marriage. People often start by falling in love, and they go on for years without realizing that love must change into some other love which is so unlike it that it can hardly be recognized as love at all.::Iris Murdoch
We shall be better prepared for the future if we see how terrible, how doomed the present is.::Iris Murdoch

An optimist is a person who starts a new diet on Thanksgiving Day.::Irv Kupcinet
What can you say about a society that says that God is dead and Elvis is alive?::Irv Kupcinet
I love my early movies, but naturalism is an artist's early style. Now I want to deal with feelings, dreams, an acceptance of irrationality.::Irvin Kershner
A person who has sympathy for mankind in the lump, faith in its future progress, and desire to serve the great cause of this progress, should be called not a humanist, but a humanitarian, and his creed may be designated as humanitarianism.::Irving Babbitt
Act strenuously, would appear to be our faith, and right thinking will take care of itself.::Irving Babbitt
The democratic idealist is prone to make light of the whole question of standards and leadership because of his unbounded faith in the plain people.::Irving Babbitt
Tell him, on the contrary, that he needs, in the interest of his own happiness, to walk in the path of humility and self-control, and he will be indifferent, or even actively resentful.::Irving Babbitt
Since every man desires happiness, it is evidently no small matter whether he conceives of happiness in terms of work or of enjoyment.::Irving Babbitt
For behind all imperialism is ultimately the imperialistic individual, just as behind all peace is ultimately the peaceful individual.::Irving Babbitt
To harmonize the One with the Many, this is indeed a difficult adjustment, perhaps the most difficult of all, and so important, withal, that nations have perished from their failure to achieve it.::Irving Babbitt
We must not, however, be like the leaders of the great romantic revolt who, in their eagerness to get rid of the husk of convention, disregarded also the humane aspiration.::Irving Babbitt
Perhaps as good a classification as any of the main types is that of the three lusts distinguished by traditional Christianity - the lust of knowledge, the lust of sensation, and the lust of power.::Irving Babbitt
The humanities need to be defended today against the encroachments of physical science, as they once needed to be against the encroachment of theology.::Irving Babbitt
The humanitarian lays stress almost solely upon breadth of knowledge and sympathy.::Irving Babbitt
Inasmuch as society cannot go on without discipline of some kind, men were constrained, in the absence of any other form of discipline, to turn to discipline of the military type.::Irving Babbitt
The true humanist maintains a just balance between sympathy and selection.::Irving Babbitt
Life is 10 percent what you make it, and 90 percent how you take it.::Irving Berlin

Democracy does not guarantee equality of conditions - it only guarantees equality of opportunity.::Irving Kristol
The scientist is motivated primarily by curiosity and a desire for truth.::Irving Langmuir
Science, almost from its beginnings, has been truly international in character. National prejudices disappear completely in the scientist's search for truth.::Irving Langmuir
The romantic idea is that everybody around a writer must suffer for his talent. I think a writer is a citizen of humanity, part of his nation, part of his family. He may have to make some compromises.::Irwin Shaw
It takes more than capital to swing business. You've got to have the A. I. D. degree to get by - Advertising, Initiative, and Dynamics.::Isaac Asimov

It is not only the living who are killed in war.::Isaac Asimov
A subtle thought that is in error may yet give rise to fruitful inquiry that can establish truths of great value.::Isaac Asimov

John Dalton's records, carefully preserved for a century, were destroyed during the World War II bombing of Manchester. It is not only the living who are killed in war.::Isaac Asimov
Life is pleasant. Death is peaceful. It's the transition that's troublesome.::Isaac Asimov
The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.::Isaac Asimov
When I read about the way in which library funds are being cut and cut, I can only think that American society has found one more way to destroy itself.::Isaac Asimov
People who think they know everything are a great annoyance to those of us who do.::Isaac Asimov
There is a single light of science, and to brighten it anywhere is to brighten it everywhere.::Isaac Asimov

To insult someone we call him 'bestial. For deliberate cruelty and nature, 'human' might be the greater insult.::Isaac Asimov
Suppose that we are wise enough to learn and know - and yet not wise enough to control our learning and knowledge, so that we use it to destroy ourselves? Even if that is so, knowledge remains better than ignorance.::Isaac Asimov
Humanity has the stars in its future, and that future is too important to be lost under the burden of juvenile folly and ignorant superstition.::Isaac Asimov

All sorts of computer errors are now turning up. You'd be surprised to know the number of doctors who claim they are treating pregnant men.::Isaac Asimov
If knowledge can create problems, it is not through ignorance that we can solve them.::Isaac Asimov
Science fiction writers foresee the inevitable, and although problems and catastrophes may be inevitable, solutions are not.::Isaac Asimov
Part of the inhumanity of the computer is that, once it is competently programmed and working smoothly, it is completely honest.::Isaac Asimov
Dalton's records, carefully preserved for a century, were destroyed during the World War II bombing of Manchester. It is not only the living who are killed in war.::Isaac Asimov
He had read much, if one considers his long life but his contemplation was much more than his reading. He was wont to say that if he had read as much as other men he should have known no more than other men.::Isaac Asimov
Even private persons in due season, with discretion and temper, may reprove others, whom they observe to commit sin, or follow bad courses, out of charitable design, and with hope to reclaim them.::Isaac Barrow
The waste basket is the writer's best friend.::Isaac Bashevis Singer
Doubt is part of all religion. All the religious thinkers were doubters.::Isaac Bashevis Singer
I did not become a vegetarian for my health, I did it for the health of the chickens.::Isaac Bashevis Singer
The very essence of literature is the war between emotion and intellect, between life and death. When literature becomes too intellectual - when it begins to ignore the passions, the emotions - it becomes sterile, silly, and actually without substance.::Isaac Bashevis Singer
Our knowledge is a little island in a great ocean of nonknowledge.::Isaac Bashevis Singer
Life is God's novel. Let him write it.::Isaac Bashevis Singer
I am thankful, of course, for the prize and thankful to God for each story, each idea, each word, each day.::Isaac Bashevis Singer

Kindness, I've discovered, is everything in life.::Isaac Bashevis Singer
If I have done the public any service, it is due to my patient thought.::Isaac Newton
Tact is the art of making a point without making an enemy.::Isaac Newton
I was like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.::Isaac Newton
To me there has never been a higher source of earthly honor or distinction than that connected with advances in science.::Isaac Newton
To myself I am only a child playing on the beach, while vast oceans of truth lie undiscovered before me.::Isaac Newton
Errors are not in the art but in the artificers.::Isaac Newton
I despair of ever writing excellent poetry.::Isaac Rosenberg
Nobody ever told me what to read, or ever put poetry in my way.::Isaac Rosenberg
I will not leave a corner of my consciousness covered up, but saturate myself with the strange and extraordinary new conditions of this life, and it will all refine itself into poetry later on.::Isaac Rosenberg
Everywhere in the world, music enhances a hall, with one exception: Carnegie Hall enhances the music.::Isaac Stern
Learning to trust is one of life's most difficult tasks.::Isaac Watts
I would not change my blest estate for all the world calls good or great.::Isaac Watts
Acquire a government over your ideas, that they may come down when they are called, and depart when they are bidden.::Isaac Watts

The first essential in writing about anything is that the writer should have no experience of the matter.::Isadora Duncan
With what price we pay for the glory of motherhood.::Isadora Duncan
What one has not experienced, one will never understand in print.::Isadora Duncan
Any intelligent woman who reads the marriage contract, and then goes into it, deserves all the consequences.::Isadora Duncan
It has taken me years of struggle, hard work and research to learn to make one simple gesture, and I know enough about the art of writing to realize that it would take as many years of concentrated effort to write one simple, beautiful sentence.::Isadora Duncan
So that ends my first experience of matrimony, which I always thought a highly over-rated performance.::Isadora Duncan
Art is not necessary at all. All that is necessary to make this world a better place to live in is to love - to love as Christ loved, as Buddha loved.::Isadora Duncan
Liberty for wolves is death to the lambs.::Isaiah Berlin
Injustice, poverty, slavery, ignorance - these may be cured by reform or revolution. But men do not live only by fighting evils. They live by positive goals, individual and collective, a vast variety of them, seldom predictable, at times incompatible.::Isaiah Berlin
Writing poetry is the hard manual labor of the imagination.::Ishmael Reed
I used to be a discipline problem, which caused me embarrassment until I realized that being a discipline problem in a racist society is sometimes an honor.::Ishmael Reed
Of all our possessions, wisdom alone is imortal.::Isocrates
I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.::Isoroku Yamamoto

Design is not for philosophy it's for life.::Issey Miyake
Even when I work with computers, with high technology, I always try to put in the touch of the hand.::Issey Miyake
Traveling, you realize that differences are lost: each city takes to resembling all cities, places exchange their form, order, distances, a shapeless dust cloud invades the continents.::Italo Calvino
The satirist is prevented by repulsion from gaining a better knowledge of the world he is attracted to, yet he is forced by attraction to concern himself with the world that repels him.::Italo Calvino
What Romantic terminology called genius or talent or inspiration is nothing other than finding the right road empirically, following one's nose, taking shortcuts.::Italo Calvino
The public school has become the established church of secular society.::Ivan Illich
Healthy people are those who live in healthy homes on a healthy diet in an environment equally fit for birth, growth work, healing, and dying... Healthy people need no bureaucratic interference to mate, give birth, share the human condition and die.::Ivan Illich
Modern medicine is a negation of health. It isn't organized to serve human health, but only itself, as an institution. It makes more people sick than it heals.::Ivan Illich
We must rediscover the distinction between hope and expectation.::Ivan Illich
Leadership does not depend on being right.::Ivan Illich
The compulsion to do good is an innate American trait. Only North Americans seem to believe that they always should, may, and actually can choose somebody with whom to share their blessings. Ultimately this attitude leads to bombing people into the acceptance of gifts.::Ivan Illich
At the moment of death I hope to be surprised.::Ivan Illich
Effective health care depends on self-care this fact is currently heralded as if it were a discovery.::Ivan Illich
Perfect as the wing of a bird may be, it will never enable the bird to fly if unsupported by the air. Facts are the air of science. Without them a man of science can never rise.::Ivan Pavlov
But man has still another powerful resource: natural science with its strictly objective methods.::Ivan Pavlov
From the described experiment it is clear that the mere act of eating, the food even not reaching the stomach, determines the stimulation of the gastric glands.::Ivan Pavlov
It has long been known for sure that the sight of tasty food makes a hungry man's mouth water also lack of appetite has always been regarded as an undesirable phenomenon, from which one might conclude that appetite is essentially linked with the process of digestion.::Ivan Pavlov
Appetite, craving for food, is a constant and powerful stimulator of the gastric glands.::Ivan Pavlov
Edible substances evoke the secretion of thick, concentrated saliva. Why? The answer, obviously, is that this enables the mass of food to pass smoothly through the tube leading from the mouth into the stomach.::Ivan Pavlov
It goes without saying that the desire to accomplish the task with more confidence, to avoid wasting time and labour, and to spare our experimental animals as much as possible, made us strictly observe all the precautions taken by surgeons in respect to their patients.::Ivan Pavlov
In days of doubt, in days of dreary musings on my country's fate, you alone are my comfort and support, oh great, powerful, righteous, and free Russian language!::Ivan Turgenev
In the end, nature is inexorable: it has no reason to hurry and, sooner or later, it takes what belongs to it. Unconsciously and inflexibly obedient to its own laws, it doesn't know art, just as it doesn't know freedom, just as it doesn't know goodness.::Ivan Turgenev
Who among us has the strength to oppose petty egoism, those petty good feelings, pity and remorse?::Ivan Turgenev
To desire and expect nothing for oneself and to have profound sympathy for others is genuine holiness.::Ivan Turgenev
Nature creates while destroying, and doesn't care whether it creates or destroys as long as life isn't extinguished, as long as death doesn't lose its rights.::Ivan Turgenev
Death's an old joke, but each individual encounters it anew.::Ivan Turgenev
I began my career with infantile dreams of becoming a composer.::Ivor Novello
It has been argued that British girls are incapable of deep feeling or brilliant acting owing to their lack of temperament. This, I am positive, is not true.::Ivor Novello
Actors who are lovers in real life are often incapable if playing the part of lovers to an audience. It is equally true that sympathy between actors who are not lovers may create a temporary emotion that is perfectly sincere.::Ivor Novello
A visit to a cinema is a little outing in itself. It breaks the monotony of an afternoon or evening it gives a change from the surroundings of home, however pleasant.::Ivor Novello
A leopard does not change his spots, or change his feeling that spots are rather a credit.::Ivy Compton-Burnett
God has two dwellings one in heaven, and the other in a meek and thankful heart.::Izaak Walton
I love such mirth as does not make friends ashamed to look upon one another next morning.::Izaak Walton
I have laid aside business, and gone a'fishing.::Izaak Walton
Those little nimble musicians of the air, that warble forth their curious ditties, with which nature hath furnished them to the shame of art.::Izaak Walton
Living in an age of advertisement, we are perpetually disillusioned. The perfect life is spread before us every day, but it changes and withers at a touch.::J. B. Priestley
The more we elaborate our means of communication, the less we communicate.::J. B. Priestley
We should like to have some towering geniuses, to reveal us to ourselves in colour and fire, but of course they would have to fit into the pattern of our society and be able to take orders from sound administrative types.::J. B. Priestley
The greatest writers of this age... are aware of the mystery of our existence.::J. B. Priestley
Britain, which in the years immediately before this war was rapidly losing such democratic virtues as it possessed, is now being bombed and burned into democracy.::J. B. Priestley
We pay when old for the excesses of youth.::J. B. Priestley
Comedy, we may say, is society protecting itself - with a smile.::J. B. Priestley
I never read the life of any important person without discovering that he knew more and could do more than I could ever hope to know or do in half a dozen lifetimes.::J. B. Priestley
I have always been delighted at the prospect of a new day, a fresh try, one more start, with perhaps a bit of magic waiting somewhere behind the morning.::J. B. Priestley
To show a child what once delighted you, to find the child's delight added to your own - this is happiness.::J. B. Priestley
If we openly declare what is wrong with us, what is our deepest need, then perhaps the death and despair will by degrees disappear.::J. B. Priestley
Marriage is like paying an endless visit in your worst clothes.::J. B. Priestley
When I was young there was no respect for the young, and now that I am old there is no respect for the old. I missed out coming and going.::J. B. Priestley
There was no respect for youth when I was young, and now that I am old, there is no respect for age, I missed it coming and going.::J. B. Priestley
I found that it wasn't so oddball to like music and poetry and visual arts, they're kindred spirits.::J. Carter Brown
I am a kind of paranoid in reverse. I suspect people of plotting to make me happy.::J. D. Salinger
Goddam money. It always ends up making you blue as hell.::J. D. Salinger
You take somebody that cries their goddam eyes out over phoney stuff in the movies, and nine times out of ten they're mean bastards at heart.::J. D. Salinger
I'm sick of just liking people. I wish to God I could meet somebody I could respect.::J. D. Salinger
I was about half in love with her by the time we sat down. That's the thing about girls. Every time they do something pretty... you fall half in love with them, and then you never know where the hell you are.::J. D. Salinger
It's funny. All you have to do is say something nobody understands and they'll do practically anything you want them to.::J. D. Salinger
I'm sick of not having the courage to be an absolute nobody.::J. D. Salinger
Above all, I would teach him to tell the truth Truth-telling, I have found, is the key to responsible citizenship. The thousands of criminals I have seen in 40 years of law enforcement have had one thing in common: Every single one was a liar.::J. Edgar Hoover
No amount of law enforcement can solve a problem that goes back to the family.::J. Edgar Hoover
Banks are an almost irresistible attraction for that element of our society which seeks unearned money.::J. Edgar Hoover
The chief role of the universities is to prolong adolescence into middle age, at which point early retirement ensures that we lack the means or the will to enforce significant change.::J. G. Ballard
What our children have to fear is not the cars on the highways of tomorrow but our own pleasure in calculating the most elegant parameters of their deaths.::J. G. Ballard
I would sum up my fear about the future in one word: boring. And that's my one fear: that everything has happened nothing exciting or new or interesting is ever going to happen again... the future is just going to be a vast, conforming suburb of the soul.::J. G. Ballard
The American Dream has run out of gas. The car has stopped. It no longer supplies the world with its images, its dreams, its fantasies. No more. It's over. It supplies the world with its nightmares now: the Kennedy assassination, Watergate, Vietnam.::J. G. Ballard
Science and technology multiply around us. To an increasing extent they dictate the languages in which we speak and think. Either we use those languages, or we remain mute.::J. G. Ballard
Electronic aids, particularly domestic computers, will help the inner migration, the opting out of reality. Reality is no longer going to be the stuff out there, but the stuff inside your head. It's going to be commercial and nasty at the same time.::J. G. Ballard
Everything is becoming science fiction. From the margins of an almost invisible literature has sprung the intact reality of the 20th century.::J. G. Ballard
I came to live in Shepperton in 1960. I thought: the future isn't in the metropolitan areas of London. I want to go out to the new suburbs, near the film studios. This was the England I wanted to write about, because this was the new world that was emerging.::J. G. Ballard
Writing a novel is one of those modern rites of passage, I think, that lead us from an innocent world of contentment, drunkenness, and good humor, to a state of chronic edginess and the perpetual scanning of bank statements.::J. G. Ballard
The surrealists, and the modern movement in painting as a whole, seemed to offer a key to the strange postwar world with its threat of nuclear war. The dislocations and ambiguities, in cubism and abstract art as well as the surrealists, reminded me of my childhood in Shanghai.::J. G. Ballard
The future is going to be boring. The suburbanisation of the planet will continue, and the suburbanisation of the soul will follow soon after.::J. G. Ballard
I don't think it's possible to touch people's imagination today by aesthetic means.::J. G. Ballard
In a completely sane world, madness is the only freedom.::J. G. Ballard
That is ever the way. Tis all jealousy to the bride and good wishes to the corpse.::J. M. Barrie
His lordship may compel us to be equal upstairs, but there will never be equality in the servants' hall.::J. M. Barrie
I wrote The Green Eye of the Little Yellow God in five hours, but I had it all planned out. It isn't poetry and it does not pretend to be, but it does what it sets out to do.::J. Milton Hayes
Go as far as you can see when you get there, you'll be able to see farther.::J. P. Morgan
A man always has two reasons for doing anything: a good reason and the real reason.::J. P. Morgan
Money is like manure. You have to spread it around or it smells.::J. Paul Getty
The employer generally gets the employees he deserves.::J. Paul Getty
Without the element of uncertainty, the bringing off of even, the greatest business triumph would be dull, routine, and eminently unsatisfying.::J. Paul Getty
Going to work for a large company is like getting on a train. Are you going sixty miles an hour or is the train going sixty miles an hour and you're just sitting still?::J. Paul Getty
No one can possibly achieve any real and lasting success or 'get rich' in business by being a conformist.::J. Paul Getty
Formula for success: rise early, work hard, strike oil.::J. Paul Getty
There are one hundred men seeking security to one able man who is willing to risk his fortune.::J. Paul Getty
The meek shall inherit the Earth, but not its mineral rights.::J. Paul Getty
I hate to be a failure. I hate and regret the failure of my marriages. I would gladly give all my millions for just one lasting marital success.::J. Paul Getty
If you can count your money, you don't have a billion dollars.::J. Paul Getty
I buy when other people are selling.::J. Paul Getty
To succeed in business, to reach the top, an individual must know all it is possible to know about that business.::J. Paul Getty
If you can actually count your money, then you're not a rich man.::J. Paul Getty
In times of rapid change, experience could be your worst enemy.::J. Paul Getty
If you owe the bank $100 that's your problem. If you owe the bank $100 million, that's the bank's problem.::J. Paul Getty
The man who comes up with a means for doing or producing almost anything better, faster or more economically has his future and his fortune at his fingertips.::J. Paul Getty
Faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens.::J. R. R. Tolkien
I wish life was not so short, he thought. languages take such a time, and so do all the things one wants to know about.::J. R. R. Tolkien
If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.::J. R. R. Tolkien
Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger.::J. R. R. Tolkien
Courage is found in unlikely places.::J. R. R. Tolkien
The atomic bomb made the prospect of future war unendurable. It has led us up those last few steps to the mountain pass and beyond there is a different country.::J. Robert Oppenheimer
The optimist thinks this is the best of all possible worlds. The pessimist fears it is true.::J. Robert Oppenheimer
Both the man of science and the man of action live always at the edge of mystery, surrounded by it.::J. Robert Oppenheimer
When you see something that is technically sweet, you go ahead and do it and you argue about what to do about it only after you have had your technical success. That is the way it was with the atomic bomb.::J. Robert Oppenheimer
In some sort of crude sense, which no vulgarity, no humor, no overstatement can quite extinguish, the physicists have known sin and this is a knowledge which they cannot lose.::J. Robert Oppenheimer
I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.::J. Robert Oppenheimer
The biggest lesson I learned from Vietnam is not to trust our own government statements. I had no idea until then that you could not rely on them.::J. William Fulbright
In a democracy, dissent is an act of faith.::J. William Fulbright
There are many respects in which America, if it can bring itself to act with the magnanimity and the empathy appropriate to its size and power, can be an intelligent example to the world.::J. William Fulbright
Insofar as international law is observed, it provides us with stability and order and with a means of predicting the behavior of those with whom we have reciprocal legal obligations.::J. William Fulbright
Another nice thing was that I would type out letters home for the admiral's stewards. They would then feed me the same food the admiral ate.::Jack Adams
Give me golf clubs, fresh air and a beautiful partner, and you can keep the clubs and the fresh air.::Jack Benny
Age is strictly a case of mind over matter. If you don't mind, it doesn't matter.::Jack Benny
I don't deserve this award, but I have arthritis and I don't deserve that either.::Jack Benny
Gags die, humor doesn't.::Jack Benny
My art and poetry is very political now. Because you've got to find that truth within you and express yourself. Somewhere out there, I know, there will be people who will listen.::Jack Bowman
But my patriotism goes for something beyond what we have. We don't have something that I want to die for - anymore.::Jack Bowman
I've been in elementary education for years and my belief is that Christmas pageants in schools are little more than conditioning kids for the Christian religion.::Jack Bowman
I regard sports first and foremost as entertainment, so dry documentary narration is not for me.::Jack Brickhouse
It's such a beautiful sport, with no politics involved, no color, no class. Only as a youngster can you play and as a pro can you win. The game has kept me young, involved and excited and for me to be up here with gems of baseball.::Jack Buck
The biggest kick I get is to communicate with those who are exiled from the game - in hospitals, homes, prisons - those who have seldom seen a game, who can't travel to a game, those who are blind.::Jack Buck
By forgetting the past and by throwing myself into other interests, I forget to worry.::Jack Dempsey
Tell him he can have my title, but I want it back in the morning.::Jack Dempsey
Growing hemp as nature designed it is vital to our urgent need to reduce greenhouse gases and ensure the survival of our planet.::Jack Herer
Rag paper, containing hemp fiber, is the highest quality and longest lasting paper ever made. It can be torn when wet, but returns to its full strength when dry.::Jack Herer
When I went off to the army when I was 17 years old, I believed in America and the rights of freedom. But today I believe my government is lying to the American people and that my president, George Bush, is a criminal.::Jack Herer
But you can count the dead bodies from alcohol, tobacco, and legal pharmaceuticals by the millions.::Jack Herer
There are a lot of grotesqueries in politics, not the least of which is the fund-raising side.::Jack Kemp
American society as a whole can never achieve the outer-reaches of potential, so long as it tolerates the inner cities of despair.::Jack Kemp
Republicans many times can't get the words 'equality of opportunity' out of their mouths. Their lips do not form that way.::Jack Kemp
My passion for ideas is not matched with a passion for partisan or electoral politics.::Jack Kemp
Just as the left has to be more willing to question 'Government knows best,' the right has to rethink its laissez-faire attitude toward government.::Jack Kemp
Our goals for this nation must be nothing less than to double the size of our economy and bring prosperity and jobs, ownership and equality of opportunity to all Americans, especially those living in our nation's pockets of poverty.::Jack Kemp
I can't understand why the Democratic parties seem so hostile to economic growth and business.::Jack Kemp
There are no limits to our future if we don't put limits on our people.::Jack Kemp
With the end of the cold war, all the 'isms' of the 20th century - Fascism, Nazism, Communism and the evil of apartheid-ism - have failed. Except one. Only democracy has shown itself true the help of all mankind.::Jack Kemp
I learned about the market's power when I was traded to the Buffalo Bills for $100.::Jack Kemp
Councils of war breed timidity and defeatism.::Jack Kemp
To Republicans, I humbly suggest that we make it possible for Democrats to give up their quest for redistribution of income and wealth by our acceptance of an appropriate role for government in financing those public goods and services necessary to secure a social safety net below which no American would be allowed to fall.::Jack Kemp
The only thing I can do is tell the truth as I see it and let the chips fall where they may.::Jack Kemp
Pro football gave me a good sense of perspective to enter politics: I'd already been booed, cheered, cut, sold, traded and hung in effigy.::Jack Kemp
The zeitgeist is for cutting spending and balancing the budget. But I do not want the Republican Party to be perceived as putting the budget ahead of people, jobs and education.::Jack Kemp
Sports are one of the main cultural activities on the face of the earth.::Jack Kent Cooke
All human beings are also dream beings. Dreaming ties all mankind together.::Jack Kerouac
Write in recollection and amazement for yourself.::Jack Kerouac
A pain stabbed my heart as it did every time I saw a girl I loved who was going the opposite direction in this too-big world.::Jack Kerouac
I hope it is true that a man can die and yet not only live in others but give them life, and not only life, but that great consciousness of life.::Jack Kerouac
My fault, my failure, is not in the passions I have, but in my lack of control of them.::Jack Kerouac
Great things are not accomplished by those who yield to trends and fads and popular opinion.::Jack Kerouac
Whither goest thou, America, in thy shiny car in the night?::Jack Kerouac
Mankind is like dogs, not gods - as long as you don't get mad they'll bite you - but stay mad and you'll never be bitten. Dogs don't respect humility and sorrow.::Jack Kerouac
Let's hope you feel better now.::Jack Kevorkian
What looks like enjoyment is the sneer of contempt. That's not a smile.::Jack Kevorkian
I don't enjoy good food. I don't enjoy flashy cars. I don't care if I live in a dump. I don't enjoy good clothes. This is the best I've dressed in months.::Jack Kevorkian
The American people are sheep. They're comfortable, rich, working. It's like the Romans, they're happy with bread and their spectator sports. The Super Bowl means more to them than any right.::Jack Kevorkian
My ultimate aim is to make euthanasia a positive experience.::Jack Kevorkian
Am I a criminal? The world knows I'm not a criminal. What are they trying to put me in jail for? You've lost common sense in this society because of religious fanaticism and dogma.::Jack Kevorkian
The patient's autonomy always, always should be respected, even if it is absolutely contrary - the decision is contrary to best medical advice and what the physician wants.::Jack Kevorkian
As a medical doctor, it is my duty to evaluate the situation with as much data as I can gather and as much expertise as I have and as much experience as I have to determine whether or not the wish of the patient is medically justified.::Jack Kevorkian
The Supreme Court of the United States... has validated the Nazi method of execution in... concentration camps, starving them to death.::Jack Kevorkian
My religion centers in different areas than what's considered conventional religion.::Jack Kevorkian
I hate to say this, but I'll repeat it: After death, all we know that you do is stink.::Jack Kevorkian
I gambled and I lost. I failed in securing my options for this choice for myself, but I succeeded in verifying the Dark Age is still with us.::Jack Kevorkian
Fear controls you.::Jack Kevorkian
I'm trying to knock the medical profession into accepting its responsibilities, and those responsibilities include assisting their patients with death.::Jack Kevorkian
Freedom has a price. Most people aren't willing to pay it.::Jack Kevorkian
There is nothing anyone can do anyway. The public has no power. The government knows I'm not a criminal. The parole board knows I'm not a criminal. The judge knows I'm not a criminal.::Jack Kevorkian
This could never be a crime in any society which deems himself enlightened.::Jack Kevorkian
I'm not a romantic.::Jack Kevorkian
I will admit, like Socrates and Aristotle and Plato and some other philosophers, that there are instances where the death penalty would seem appropriate.::Jack Kevorkian
Not one has shown an iota of fear of death. They want to end this agony.::Jack Kevorkian
You're basing your laws and your whole outlook on natural life on mythology. It won't work. That's why you have all these problems in the world. Name them: India, Pakistan, Ireland. Name them-all these problems. They're all religious problems.::Jack Kevorkian
You've gotta know what death is to know life!::Jack Kevorkian
If Christ can die in a barn, I think the death of a human in a van is not so bad.::Jack Kevorkian
A transfer of money should never be involved in this profound situation. Although illness is profound, too, but medicine's a business today. It's a business.::Jack Kevorkian
I'm sure there will continue to be exciting new products and major changes, but it looks as if the existing technology has a great deal of room to grow and prosper.::Jack Kilby
I think I thought it would be important for electronics as we knew it then, but that was a much simpler business and electronics was mostly radio and television and the first computers.::Jack Kilby
Well, it's very dangerous to project, but it's clear that the existing technology has some more years to go.::Jack Kilby
Well, the big products in electronics in the '50s were radio and television. The first big computers were just beginning to come in and represented the most logical market for us to work in.::Jack Kilby
For 50 years, acting was the reason I got up in the morning.::Jack Klugman
Probably millions of Americans got up this morning with a cup of coffee, a cigarette and a donut. No wonder they are sick and fouled up.::Jack LaLanne
You don't have to call it God or Jesus. That's religious humbug to a lot of people, but you've gotta believe that nature and spiritual things surround us. That is what put us here! I thank the universe for that every day of my life.::Jack LaLanne
Do you know how many calories are in butter and cheese and ice cream? Would you get your dog up in the morning for a cup of coffee and a donut?::Jack LaLanne
If you've got a big gut and you start doing sit-ups, you are going to get bigger because you build up the muscle. You've got to get rid of that fat! How do you get rid of fat? By changing your diet.::Jack LaLanne
We don't know all the answers. If we knew all the answers we'd be bored, wouldn't we? We keep looking, searching, trying to get more knowledge.::Jack LaLanne
Look at the average American diet: ice cream, butter, cheese, whole milk, all this fat. People don't realize how much of this stuff you get by the end of the day. High blood pressure is from all this high-fat eating.::Jack LaLanne
You can't get rid of it with exercise alone. You can do the most vigorous exercise and only burn up 300 calories in an hour. If you've got fat on your body, the exercise firms and tones the muscles. But when you use that tape measure, what makes it bigger? It's the fat!::Jack LaLanne
So many older people, they just sit around all day long and they don't get any exercise. Their muscles atrophy, and they lose their strength, their energy and vitality by inactivity.::Jack LaLanne
The only way you get that fat off is to eat less and exercise more.::Jack LaLanne
Focus on your problem zones, your strength, your energy, your flexibility and all the rest. Maybe your chest is flabby or your hips or waist need toning. Also, you should change your program every thirty days. That's the key.::Jack LaLanne
If you think it's hard to meet new people, try picking up the wrong golf ball.::Jack Lemmon
Stay humble. Always answer your phone - no matter who else is in the car.::Jack Lemmon
Failure seldom stops you. What stops you is the fear of failure.::Jack Lemmon
I write for no other purpose than to add to the beauty that now belongs to me. I write a book for no other reason than to add three or four hundred acres to my magnificent estate.::Jack London
You can't wait for inspiration. You have to go after it with a club.::Jack London
The proper function of man is to live, not to exist. I shall not waste my days in trying to prolong them. I shall use my time.::Jack London
Beer, it's the best damn drink in the world.::Jack Nicholson
I sort of understood that when I first started: that you shouldn't repeat a success. Very often you're going to, and maybe the first time you do, it works. And you love it. But then you're trapped.::Jack Nicholson
I never had a policy about marriage. I got married very young in life and I always think in all relationships, I've always thought that it's counterproductive to have a theory on that.::Jack Nicholson
Early on, if I was alone two three nights in a row, I'd start writing poems about suicide.::Jack Nicholson
Well, a girlfriend once told me never to fight with anybody you don't love.::Jack Nicholson
There were points in my life where I felt oddly irresistible to women. I'm not in that state now and that makes me sad.::Jack Nicholson
Age is the first limitation on roles that I've ever had to encounter, and I hit that awhile ago.::Jack Nicholson
There's only two people in your life you should lie to... the police and your girlfriend.::Jack Nicholson
When I am cast in a movie where I feel that the woman's part is more interesting, I usually start thinking about Spencer Tracy and Fred Astaire. They seem to be the most clear actors when working with women.::Jack Nicholson
If men are honest, everything they do and everywhere they go is for a chance to see women.::Jack Nicholson
Frankly, I got into the movies because I like the movies a lot.::Jack Nicholson
I think that's what distinguishes Schmidt, really. In the movies now, so much of what is appealing to an audience is the dramatic or has to do with science fiction, and Schmidt is simply human. There's no melodrama there's no device, It's just about a human being.::Jack Nicholson
Financially, I've lost money and made money, but I know my way around financially.::Jack Nicholson
I can't hit on women in public any more. I didn't decide this it just doesn't feel right at my age.::Jack Nicholson
I don't have any fear of intimacy, but rather thrive on it, which is rare in a public person.::Jack Nicholson
I'll tell you one thing: Don't ever give anybody your best advice, because they're not going to follow it.::Jack Nicholson
The minute that you're not learning I believe you're dead.::Jack Nicholson
I'm Irish. I think about death all the time.::Jack Nicholson
A star on a movie set is like a time bomb. That bomb has got to be defused so people can approach it without fear.::Jack Nicholson
I just like art. I get pure pleasure from it. I have a lot of wonderful paintings, and every time I look at them I see something different.::Jack Nicholson
It's a slight stretch of the imagination but most people are alike in most ways so I've never had any trouble identifying with the character that I'm playing.::Jack Nicholson
We are going as fast as we can as soon as we can. We're in a race against time, until we run out of money.::Jack Nicholson
I'm not a power person. I like everyone to be on an equal footing.::Jack Nicholson
In 1934, the American Jewish charities offered to find homes for 300 German refugee children. We were on the SS Washington, bound for New York, Christmas 1934.::Jack Steinberger
I do read books. I suppose it's more or less the same thing, but at least I'm alone and I'm an individual. I can stop anytime I want, which I frequently do.::Jack Vance
Right now I'm so old that if I had a big gush of money, I don't know what I'd do with it. I don't travel anymore. I don't need anything, don't want anything. I'd give it to my son, I guess, and let him enjoy it.::Jack Vance
But I'm so slow on it because I find it terribly hard writing blind on computers. The computer speaks to me, but it's just so slow, I'm so terribly slow using it.::Jack Vance
I don't read other science fiction. I don't read any at all.::Jack Vance
Then there was Clark Ashton Smith, who wrote for Weird Tales and who had a wild imagination. He wasn't a very talented writer, but his imagination was wonderful.::Jack Vance
But Roy Rockwood, it was science fiction for the sake of science fiction.::Jack Vance
Short cycle business are being impacted by credit, and are being impacted by gasoline prices, food, distribution businesses, chemical business.::Jack Welch
In order to lead a country or a company, you've got to get everybody on the same page and you've got to be able to have a vision of where you're going. America can't have a vision of health care for everybody, green economy, regulations - can't have a bunch of piece-meal activities. It's got to have a vision.::Jack Welch
You've got to eat while you dream. You've got to deliver on short-range commitments, while you develop a long-range strategy and vision and implement it.::Jack Welch
An organization's ability to learn, and translate that learning into action rapidly, is the ultimate competitive advantage.::Jack Welch
I was afraid of the internet... because I couldn't type.::Jack Welch
Don't manage - lead change before you have to.::Jack Welch
I actually think that the economy has got some positives. It's got the market. It's got consumer confidence and it's got banks throwing - I mean central bankers throwing money at it around the world.::Jack Welch
Control your own destiny or someone else will.::Jack Welch
Good business leaders create a vision, articulate the vision, passionately own the vision, and relentlessly drive it to completion.::Jack Welch
The Internet is the Viagra of big business.::Jack Welch
Number one, cash is king... number two, communicate... number three, buy or bury the competition.::Jack Welch
If GE's strategy of investment in China is wrong, it represents a loss of a billion dollars, perhaps a couple of billion dollars. If it is right, it is the future of this company for the next century.::Jack Welch
If you don't have public hangings for bad culture in a company, if you don't take people out and let them say, they went home to spend more time with the family. It's crazy.::Jack Welch
Change before you have to.::Jack Welch
A strategy is something like, an innovative new product globalization, taking your products around the world be the low-cost producer. A strategy is something you can touch you can motivate people with be number one and number two in every business. You can energize people around the message.::Jack Welch
What's important at the grocery store is just as important in engines or medical systems. If the customer isn't satisfied, if the stuff is getting stale, if the shelf isn't right, or if the offerings aren't right, it's the same thing. You manage it like a small organization. You don't get hung up on zeros.::Jack Welch
The productivity now at universities is terrible. Tenure is a terrible idea. It keeps them around forever and they don't have to work hard.::Jack Welch
I've learned that mistakes can often be as good a teacher as success.::Jack Welch
Willingness to change is a strength, even if it means plunging part of the company into total confusion for a while.::Jack Welch
If you want to achieve your dreams, you must follow them, and the best way to follow them is not to think about wanting to be very rich, but to think about doing something that you really want to do.::Jackie Collins
I would also like to act, once in a while, but not get up every morning at 5:30 or six o'clock and pound into the studio and get home at 7:30 or eight o'clock at night, or act over and over and over every night on Broadway, either.::Jackie Cooper
Our dreams are firsthand creations, rather than residues of waking life. We have the capacity for infinite creativity at least while dreaming, we partake of the power of the Spirit, the infinite Godhead that creates the cosmos.::Jackie Gleason
How sweet it is!::Jackie Gleason
The second day of a diet is always easier than the first. By the second day you're off it.::Jackie Gleason
I don't believe that anybody has come to a conclusion on why something is funny. It's funny because it's ridiculous and it's ridiculous for different reasons at different times.::Jackie Mason
I can't predict the future and I don't have respect for people who try to.::Jackie Mason
I guess you'd call me an independent, since I've never identified myself with one party or another in politics. I always decide my vote by taking as careful a look as I can at the actual candidates and issues themselves, no matter what the party label.::Jackie Robinson
I'm not concerned with your liking or disliking me... All I ask is that you respect me as a human being.::Jackie Robinson
A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives.::Jackie Robinson
We were racing at circuits where there were no crash barriers in front of the pits, and fuel was lying about in churns in the pit lane. A car could easily crash into the pits at any time. It was ridiculous.::Jackie Stewart
There has been a huge advance in technology, which has improved the safety of the cars incredibly, but there are still some heavy crash impacts and in certain circumstances there is still the chance of fire today.::Jackie Stewart
It takes leadership to improve safety. And I started off the movement in my time, but the person who has done more over the past 20 to 30 years and who has led it is Professor Sid Watkins.::Jackie Stewart
I have no fear of making changes, destroying the image, etc., because the painting has a life of its own.::Jackson Pollock
My painting does not come from the easel.::Jackson Pollock
New needs need new techniques. And the modern artists have found new ways and new means of making their statements... the modern painter cannot express this age, the airplane, the atom bomb, the radio, in the old forms of the Renaissance or of any other past culture.::Jackson Pollock
The strangeness will wear off and I think we will discover the deeper meanings in modern art.::Jackson Pollock
Every good painter paints what he is.::Jackson Pollock
No science is immune to the infection of politics and the corruption of power.::Jacob Bronowski
We are all afraid for our confidence, for the future, for the world. That is the nature of the human imagination. Yet every man, every civilization, has gone forward because of its engagement with what it has set itself to do.::Jacob Bronowski
You will die but the carbon will not its career does not end with you. It will return to the soil, and there a plant may take it up again in time, sending it once more on a cycle of plant and animal life.::Jacob Bronowski
Man masters nature not by force but by understanding. This is why science has succeeded where magic failed: because it has looked for no spell to cast over nature.::Jacob Bronowski
The most wonderful discovery made by scientists is science itself.::Jacob Bronowski
Has there ever been a society which has died of dissent? Several have died of conformity in our lifetime.::Jacob Bronowski
Knowledge is an unending adventure at the edge of uncertainty.::Jacob Bronowski
Man is unique not because he does science, and his is unique not because he does art, but because science and art equally are expressions of his marvelous plasticity of mind.::Jacob Bronowski
Science has nothing to be ashamed of even in the ruins of Nagasaki. The shame is theirs who appeal to other values than the human imaginative values which science has evolved.::Jacob Bronowski
Every animal leaves traces of what it was man alone leaves traces of what he created.::Jacob Bronowski
That is the essence of science: ask an impertinent question, and you are on the way to a pertinent answer.::Jacob Bronowski
It comes with faith, for with complete faith there is no fear of what faces you in life or death.::Jacqueline Cochran
I have found adventure in flying, in world travel, in business, and even close at hand... Adventure is a state of mind - and spirit.::Jacqueline Cochran
I might have been born in a hovel but I am determined to travel with the wind and the stars.::Jacqueline Cochran
Schools are not intended to moralize a wicked world, but to impart knowledge and develop intelligence, with only two social aims in mind: prepare to take on one's share in the world's work, and perhaps in addition, lend a hand in improving society, after schooling is done.::Jacques Barzun
The test and the use of man's education is that he finds pleasure in the exercise of his mind.::Jacques Barzun
Music is intended and designed for sentient beings that have hopes and purposes and emotions.::Jacques Barzun
It seems a long time since the morning mail could be called correspondence.::Jacques Barzun
Except among those whose education has been in the minimalist style, it is understood that hasty moral judgments about the past are a form of injustice.::Jacques Barzun
The construction of Europe is an art. It is the art of the possible.::Jacques Chirac
Terrorism takes us back to ages we thought were long gone if we allow it a free hand to corrupt democratic societies and destroy the basic rules of international life.::Jacques Chirac
The problem of how we finance the welfare state should not obscure a separate issue: if each person thinks he has an inalienable right to welfare, no matter what happens to the world, that's not equity, it's just creating a society where you can't ask anything of people.::Jacques Delors
We have to struggle against the conservatives from all sides, not only the right-wingers, but also the left-wing conservatives who don't want to change anything.::Jacques Delors
Modern technology has become a total phenomenon for civilization, the defining force of a new social order in which efficiency is no longer an option but a necessity imposed on all human activity.::Jacques Ellul
All human language draws its nature and value from the fact that it both comes from the Word of God and is chosen by God to manifest himself. But this relationship is secret and incomprehensible, beyond the bounds of reason and analysis.::Jacques Ellul
The Holy Spirit alone can do this, the Holy Spirit alone can establish this link with one's neighbor.::Jacques Ellul
We emphasize that such a form of communication is not absent in man, however evanescent a naturally given object may be for him, split as it is in its submission to symbols.::Jacques Lacan
As is known, it is in the realm of experience inaugurated by psychoanalysis that we may grasp along what imaginary lines the human organism, in the most intimate recesses of its being, manifests its capture in a symbolic dimension.::Jacques Lacan
The knowledge that there is a part of the psychic functions that are out of conscious reach, we did not need to wait for Freud to know this!::Jacques Lacan

New Year's Resolution: To tolerate fools more gladly, provided this does not encourage them to take up more of my time.::James Agate

Science rests on reason and experiment, and can meet an opponent with calmness but a belief is always sensitive.::James Anthony Froude
In everyday things the law of sacrifice takes the form of positive duty.::James Anthony Froude

We enter the world alone, we leave the world alone.::James Anthony Froude
An identity would seem to be arrived at by the way in which the person faces and uses his experience.::James Baldwin
The primary distinction of the artist is that he must actively cultivate that state which most men, necessarily, must avoid the state of being alone.::James Baldwin
But the relationship of morality and power is a very subtle one. Because ultimately power without morality is no longer power.::James Baldwin

Patriotism is the religion of hell.::James Branch Cabell

Poetry for me is as much a spiritual practice as sexual ecstasy is.::James Broughton
Everything that ever happened is still happening. Past, present and future keep happening in the eternity which is Here and Now.::James Broughton
Trusting your individual uniqueness challenges you to lay yourself open.::James Broughton
I tried to stir the imagination and enthusiasms of students to take risks, to do what they were most afraid of doing, to widen their horizons of action.::James Broughton
For me, prose walks, poetry dances.::James Broughton
Being identified as a poet in France or Denmark or India one is greeted with gracious respect.::James Broughton

Amazement awaits us at every corner.::James Broughton
Today the U.S. is farther from being nourished by poetry than it was a hundred years ago, when books of poems were best-sellers.::James Broughton
Dance, vaudeville, drama, movies - as a child I loved everything that went on in a theater.::James Broughton
My films are an extension of my poetry, using the white screen like the white page to be filled with images.::James Broughton
I'm happy to report that my inner child is still ageless.::James Broughton
I'm kidding about having only a few dollars. I might have a few dollars more.::James Brown

I just thank God for all of the blessings.::James Brown
Like Christ said, love thee one another. I learned to do that, and I learned to respect and be appreciative and thankful for what I had.::James Brown

The test of leadership is not to put greatness into humanity, but to elicit it, for the greatness is already there.::James Buchanan
Perhaps people, and kids especially, are spoiled today, because all the kids today have cars, it seems. When I was young you were lucky to have a bike.::James Cagney
You know, the period of World War I and the Roaring Twenties were really just about the same as today. You worked, and you made a living if you could, and you tired to make the best of things. For an actor or a dancer, it was no different then than today. It was a struggle.::James Cagney
A leader must have the courage to act against an expert's advice.::James Callaghan
Responsibilities are given to him on whom trust rests. Responsibility is always a sign of trust.::James Cash Penney

The greatest teacher I know is the job itself.::James Cash Penney
The best teamwork comes from men who are working independently toward one goal in unison.::James Cash Penney
The Golden Rule finds no limit of application in business.::James Cash Penney

I believe in trusting men, not only once but twice - in giving a failure another chance.::James Cash Penney
Men are not great or small because of their material possessions. They are great or small because of what they are.::James Cash Penney

The art of effective listening is essential to clear communication, and clear communication is necessary to management success.::James Cash Penney

Dream as if you'll live forever. Live as if you'll die today.::James Dean
Only the gentle are ever really strong.::James Dean
If a man can bridge the gap between life and death, if he can live on after he's dead, then maybe he was a great man.::James Dean
Trust and belief are two prime considerations. You must not allow yourself to be opinionated.::James Dean
I think the one thing this picture shows that's new is the psychological disproportion of the kids' demands on the parents. Parents are often at fault, but the kids have some work to do, too.::James Dean
There is no way to be truly great in this world. We are all impaled on the crook of conditioning.::James Dean
I also became close to nature, and am now able to appreciate the beauty with which this world is endowed.::James Dean
Being an actor is the loneliest thing in the world. You are all alone with your concentration and imagination, and that's all you have.::James Dean
She was the Judy Garland of American poetry.::James Dickey
The New York Quarterly is an amazing, intelligent, crazy, creative, strange, and indispensable magazine.::James Dickey
I think Ginsberg has done more harm to the craft that I honor and live by than anybody else by reducing it to a kind of mean that enables the most dubious practitioners to claim they are poets because they think, If the kind of thing Ginsberg does is poetry, I can do that.::James Dickey
I want a fever, in poetry: a fever, and tranquillity.::James Dickey
Children are not casual guests in our home. They have been loaned to us temporarily for the purpose of loving them and instilling a foundation of values on which their future lives will be built.::James Dobson
I'm certain that most couples expect to find intimacy in marriage, but it somehow eludes them.::James Dobson
One of the most important responsibilities in the Christian life is to care about others, smile at them, and be a friend to the friendless.::James Dobson
My observation is that women are merely waiting for their husbands to assume leadership.::James Dobson
My favorite type of music to sing and to listen to, you know, rock. It's not always metal, but you know, half the time it is. Metal's cool, you know? Not everybody on 'American Idol' listens to metal.::James Durbin
One measure of your success will be the degree to which you build up others who work with you. While building up others, you will build up yourself.::James E. Casey
Acting is not about anything romantic, not even fantasy, although you do create fantasy.::James Earl Jones
And nothing embittered me, which is important, because I think ethnic people and women in this society can end up being embittered because of the lack of affirmative action, you know.::James Earl Jones
I don't ever want to be a sentimentalist. I prefer to be a realist. I'm not a romantic really.::James Earl Jones
The arts have always been an important ingredient to the health of a nation, but we haven't gotten there yet.::James Earl Jones
It has to be real, and I think a lot of the problems we have as a society is because we don't acknowledge that family is important, and it has to be people who are present, you know, and mothers and fathers, both are not present enough with children.::James Earl Jones
The carrying out of the Potsdam Agreement has, however, been obstructed by the failure of the Allied Control Council to take the necessary steps to enable the German economy to function as an economic unit.::James F. Byrnes

The world is full of poetry. The air is living with its spirit and the waves dance to the music of its melodies, and sparkle in its brightness.::James Gates Percival
I hope to make people realize how totally helpless animals are, how dependent on us, trusting as a child must that we will be kind and take care of their needs.::James Herriot
If having a soul means being able to feel love and loyalty and gratitude, then animals are better off than a lot of humans.::James Herriot
I am never at my best in the early morning, especially a cold morning in the Yorkshire spring with a piercing March wind sweeping down from the fells, finding its way inside my clothing, nipping at my nose and ears.::James Herriot
I wish people would realize that animals are totally dependent on us, helpless, like children, a trust that is put upon us.::James Herriot
For years I used to bore my wife over lunch with stories about funny incidents.::James Herriot
I have felt cats rubbing their faces against mine and touching my cheek with claws carefully sheathed. These things, to me, are expressions of love.::James Herriot
Cats are connoisseurs of comfort.::James Herriot
I don't think anything changes until ideas change. The usual American viewpoint is to believe that something is wrong with the person.::James Hillman
Just stop for a minute and you'll realize you're happy just being. I think it's the pursuit that screws up happiness. If we drop the pursuit, it's right here.::James Hillman
Psychotherapy theory turns it all on you: you are the one who is wrong. If a kid is having trouble or is discouraged, the problem is not just inside the kid it's also in the system, the society.::James Hillman
We can't change anything until we get some fresh ideas, until we begin to see things differently.::James Hillman
We approach people the same way we approach our cars. We take the poor kid to a doctor and ask, What's wrong with him, how much will it cost, and when can I pick him up?::James Hillman
The older people that one admires seem to be fearless. They go right out into the world. It's astounding. Maybe they can't see or they can't hear, but they walk out into the street and take life as it comes. They're models of courage, in a strange way.::James Hillman
The word power has such a generally negative implication in our society. What are people talking about? Are they talking about muscles, or control?::James Hillman
Depression opens the door to beauty of some kind.::James Hillman
In the history of the treatment of depression, there was the dunking stool, purging of the bowels of black bile, hoses, attempts to shock the patient. All of these represent hatred or aggression towards what depression represents in the patient.::James Hillman
We're an air bag society that wants guarantees on everything that we buy. We want to be able to take everything back and get another one. We want a 401-k plan and Social Security.::James Hillman
I see happiness as a by-product. I don't think you can pursue happiness. I think that phrase is one of the very few mistakes the Founding Fathers made.::James Hillman
All we can do when we think of kids today is think of more hours of school, earlier age at the computer, and curfews. Who would want to grow up in that world?::James Hillman
Fear is a huge thing for older people.::James Hillman
The culture is going into a psychological depression. We are concerned about our place in the world, about being competitive: Will my children have as much as I have? Will I ever own my own home? How can I pay for a new car? Are immigrants taking away my white world?::James Hillman
It's very hard to know what wisdom is.::James Hillman
Loss means losing what was We want to change but we don't want to lose. Without time for loss, we don't have time for soul.::James Hillman
Everything that everyone is afraid of has already happened: The fragility of capitalism, which we don't want to admit the loss of the empire of the United States and American exceptionalism. In fact, American exceptionalism is that we are exceptionally backward in about fifteen different categories, from education to infrastructure.::James Hillman
You don't attack the grunts of Vietnam you blame the theory behind the war. Nobody who fought in that war was at fault. It was the war itself that was at fault. It's the same thing with psychotherapy.::James Hillman
He dares to be a fool, and that is the first step in the direction of wisdom.::James Huneker
All men of action are dreamers.::James Huneker
The Earth reminded us of a Christmas tree ornament hanging in the blackness of space. As we got farther and farther away it diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful marble you can imagine.::James Irwin
Only those who have patience to do simple things perfectly ever acquire the skill to do difficult things easily.::James J. Corbett
To travel hopefully is better than to arrive.::James Jeans
The object of pure physics is the unfolding of the laws of the intelligible world the object of pure mathematics that of unfolding the laws of human intelligence.::James Joseph Sylvester
Men are governed by lines of intellect - women: by curves of emotion.::James Joyce
Irresponsibility is part of the pleasure of all art it is the part the schools cannot recognize.::James Joyce
Poetry, even when apparently most fantastic, is always a revolt against artifice, a revolt, in a sense, against actuality.::James Joyce
Ireland sober is Ireland stiff.::James Joyce
Satan, really, is the romantic youth of Jesus re-appearing for a moment.::James Joyce
Think you're escaping and run into yourself. Longest way round is the shortest way home.::James Joyce
I think a child should be allowed to take his father's or mother's name at will on coming of age. Paternity is a legal fiction.::James Joyce
Better pass boldly into that other world, in the full glory of some passion, than fade and wither dismally with age.::James Joyce
The actions of men are the best interpreters of their thoughts.::James Joyce
I fear those big words which make us so unhappy.::James Joyce
I am tomorrow, or some future day, what I establish today. I am today what I established yesterday or some previous day.::James Joyce
Love between man and man is impossible because there must not be sexual intercourse and friendship between man and woman is impossible because there must be sexual intercourse.::James Joyce
Well may the boldest fear and the wisest tremble when incurring responsibilities on which may depend our country's peace and prosperity, and in some degree the hopes and happiness of the whole human family.::James K. Polk
The world has nothing to fear from military ambition in our Government.::James K. Polk
Peace, plenty, and contentment reign throughout our borders, and our beloved country presents a sublime moral spectacle to the world.::James K. Polk
Although... the Chief Magistrate must almost of necessity be chosen by a party and stand pledged to its principles and measures, yet in his official action he should not be the President of a party only, but of the whole people of the United States.::James K. Polk
One great object of the Constitution was to restrain majorities from oppressing minorities or encroaching upon their just rights.::James K. Polk
What distinguishes the campaign finance issue from just about every other one being debated these days is that the two sides do not divide along conventional liberal\/ conservative lines.::James L. Buckley
In the last analysis, of course, an oath will encourage fidelity in office only to the degree that officeholders continue to believe that they cannot escape ultimate accountability for a breach of faith.::James L. Buckley
As you think, you travel, and as you love, you attract. You are today where your thoughts have brought you you will be tomorrow where your thoughts take you.::James Lane Allen
He who has conquered doubt and fear has conquered failure.::James Lane Allen
You cannot travel within and stand still without.::James Lane Allen
You cannot escape the results of your thoughts. Whatever your present environment may be, you will fall, remain or rise with your thoughts, your vision, your ideal. You will become as small as your controlling desire as great as your dominant aspiration.::James Lane Allen
There must be freedom for all to live, to think, to worship, no book, no avenue must be closed.::James Larkin
The question of religion was a matter for each individual's conscience, and in a great many cases was the outcome of birth or residence in a certain geographical area.::James Larkin
No, men and women of the Irish race, we shall not fight for England. We shall fight for the destruction of the British Empire and the construction of an Irish republic.::James Larkin
I think there's no excuse for the American poetry reader not knowing a good deal about what is going on in the rest of the world.::James Laughlin
Concrete poets continue to turn out beautiful things, but to me they're more visual than oral, and they almost really belong on the wall rather than in a book. I haven't the least idea of where poetry is going.::James Laughlin
I think that concrete poetry seems to have, as far as I can see, come to a kind of a dead end. It doesn't seem to be going any further than it went in its high period of about five or six years ago.::James Laughlin
There are numerous cases of that, where one of our writers discovers another writer whom he likes, and we then take that book on. So it's a very close relationship. We can do that because we're so small.::James Laughlin
I think that is where poetry reading becomes such an individual thing. I mean I have friend who like poets who just don't say anything to me at all, I mean they seem to me rather ordinary and pedestrian.::James Laughlin
Then, of course, there are those sad occasions when a poet or a writer has not grown, and one has to let them go because they're just not making headway. But we have a very clear personal relationship with the authors.::James Laughlin
We don't attempt to have any theme for a number of the anthology, or to have any particular sequence. We just put in things that we like, and then we try to alternate the prose and the poetry.::James Laughlin
Of course a poem is a two-way street. No poem is any good if it doesn't suggest to the reader things from his own mind and recollection that he will read into it, and will add to what the poet has suggested. But I do think poetry readings are very important.::James Laughlin
I think we will always have the impulse towards visual poetry with us, and I wouldn't agree with Bly that it's a bad thing. It depends on the ability of the individual poet to do it well, and to make a shape which is interesting enough to hold your attention.::James Laughlin
We decry violence all the time in this country, but look at our history. We were born in a violent revolution, and we've been in wars ever since. We're not a pacific people.::James Lee Burke
Comedians don't laugh. They're too busy analyzing why it's funny or not.::James Lipton
I'm a scientist, not a theologian. I don't know if there is a God or not. Religion requires certainty.::James Lovelock
What I like about sceptics is that in good science you need critics that make you think: 'Crumbs, have I made a mistake here?'::James Lovelock
This programme to stop nuclear by 2020 is just crazy. If there were a nuclear war, and humanity were wiped out, the Earth would breathe a sigh of relief.::James Lovelock
Just after World War II, this country led the world in science by every way you could measure it, yet the number of scientists was a tiny proportion of what it is now.::James Lovelock
You mustn't take what I say as gospel because no one can second-guess the future.::James Lovelock
I've got personal views on the '60s. You can't have freedom without paying the price for it.::James Lovelock
I'm a scientist, not a theologian. I don't know if there is a God or not. Religion requires certainty. Revere and respect Gaia. Have trust in Gaia. But not faith.::James Lovelock
It just so happens that the green religion is now taking over from the Christian religion. I don't think people have noticed that, but it's got all the sort of terms that religions use... The greens use guilt. That just shows how religious greens are. You can't win people round by saying they are guilty for putting (carbon dioxide) in the air.::James Lovelock
If you start any large theory, such as quantum mechanics, plate tectonics, evolution, it takes about 40 years for mainstream science to come around. Gaia has been going for only 30 years or so.::James Lovelock
I have heard that the Saudi Arabians are paying Greenpeace to campaign against Nuclear Power. It wouldn't surprise me at all.::James Lovelock
One thing that being a scientist has taught me is that you can never be certain about anything. You never know the truth. You can only approach it and hope to get a bit nearer to it each time. You iterate towards the truth. You don't know it.::James Lovelock
There aren't just bad people that commit genocide we are all capable of it. It's our evolutionary history.::James Lovelock
Geological change usually takes thousands of years to happen but we are seeing the climate changing not just in our lifetimes but also year by year.::James Lovelock
If it hadn't been for the Cold War, neither Russia nor America would have been sending people into space.::James Lovelock
Science always uses metaphor.::James Lovelock
There is little evidence that our individual intelligence has improved through recorded history.::James Lovelock
The oil companies regard nuclear power as their rival, who will reduce their profits, so they put out a lot of disinformation about nuclear power.::James Lovelock
Fudging the data in any way whatsoever is quite literally a sin against the holy ghost of science. I'm not religious, but I put it that way because I feel so strongly. It's the one thing you do not ever do. You've got to have standards.::James Lovelock
I don't think we're yet evolved to the point where we're clever enough to handle a complex a situation as climate change. The inertia of humans is so huge that you can't really do anything meaningful.::James Lovelock
If we gave up eating beef we would have roughly 20 to 30 times more land for food than we have now.::James Lovelock
Divorced from ethics, leadership is reduced to management and politics to mere technique.::James MacGregor Burns
Woodrow Wilson called for leaders who, by boldly interpreting the nation's conscience, could lift a people out of their everyday selves. That people can be lifted into their better selves is the secret of transforming leadership.::James MacGregor Burns
A well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained in arms, is the best most natural defense of a free country.::James Madison
What is government itself but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.::James Madison
A man has a property in his opinions and the free communication of them.::James Madison
Knowledge will forever govern ignorance and a people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.::James Madison
No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.::James Madison
I have no doubt but that the misery of the lower classes will be found to abate whenever the Government assumes a freer aspect and the laws favor a subdivision of Property.::James Madison
The diversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of property originate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to an uniformity of interests. The protection of these faculties is the first object of government.::James Madison
The advancement and diffusion of knowledge is the only guardian of true liberty.::James Madison
Every nation whose affairs betray a want of wisdom and stability may calculate on every loss which can be sustained from the more systematic policy of its wiser neighbors.::James Madison
I believe there are more instances of the abridgement of freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments by those in power than by violent and sudden usurpations.::James Madison
A well-instructed people alone can be permanently a free people.::James Madison
Perhaps it is a universal truth that the loss of liberty at home is to be charged to provisions against danger, real or pretended, from abroad.::James Madison
A sincere and steadfast co-operation in promoting such a reconstruction of our political system as would provide for the permanent liberty and happiness of the United States.::James Madison
The means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home.::James Madison
Do not separate text from historical background. If you do, you will have perverted and subverted the Constitution, which can only end in a distorted, bastardized form of illegitimate government.::James Madison
What spectacle can be more edifying or more seasonable, than that of Liberty and Learning, each leaning on the other for their mutual and surest support?::James Madison
Of all the enemies of public liberty, war is perhaps the most to be dreaded, because it comprises and develops the germ of every other.::James Madison
The circulation of confidence is better than the circulation of money.::James Madison
It is a universal truth that the loss of liberty at home is to be charged to the provisions against danger, real or pretended, from abroad.::James Madison
Liberty may be endangered by the abuse of liberty, but also by the abuse of power.::James Madison
The truth is that all men having power ought to be mistrusted.::James Madison
Wherever there is interest and power to do wrong, wrong will generally be done.::James Madison
War should only be declared by the authority of the people, whose toils and treasures are to support its burdens, instead of the government which is to reap its fruits.::James Madison
To the press alone, chequered as it is with abuses, the world is indebted for all the triumphs which have been gained by reason and humanity over error and oppression.::James Madison
The loss of liberty at home is to be charged to the provisions against danger, real or imagined, from abroad.::James Madison
The happy Union of these States is a wonder their Constitution a miracle their example the hope of Liberty throughout the world.::James Madison
The executive has no right, in any case, to decide the question, whether there is or is not cause for declaring war.::James Madison
In Republics, the great danger is, that the majority may not sufficiently respect the rights of the minority.::James Madison
And I have no doubt that every new example will succeed, as every past one has done, in showing that religion and Government will both exist in greater purity, the less they are mixed together.::James Madison
The capacity of the female mind for studies of the highest order cannot be doubted, having been sufficiently illustrated by its works of genius, of erudition, and of science.::James Madison
Let me recommend the best medicine in the world: a long journey, at a mild season, through a pleasant country, in easy stages.::James Madison
A popular government without popular information or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce, or a tragedy, or perhaps both.::James Madison
War contains so much folly, as well as wickedness, that much is to be hoped from the progress of reason.::James Madison
It will be of little avail to the people that the laws are made by men of their own choice if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot be read, or so incoherent that they cannot be understood.::James Madison
Religion flourishes in greater purity, without than with the aid of Government.::James Madison
The rights of persons, and the rights of property, are the objects, for the protection of which Government was instituted.::James Madison
To suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people, is a chimerical idea.::James Madison
A pure democracy is a society consisting of a small number of citizens, who assemble and administer the government in person.::James Madison
If men were angels, no government would be necessary.::James Madison
The Constitution preserves the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation where the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.::James Madison
Whenever a youth is ascertained to possess talents meriting an education which his parents cannot afford, he should be carried forward at the public expense.::James Madison
The essence of Government is power and power, lodged as it must be in human hands, will ever be liable to abuse.::James Madison
If we are to take for the criterion of truth the majority of suffrages, they ought to be gotten from those philosophic and patriotic citizens who cultivate their reason.::James Madison
In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men you must first enable the government to control the governed and in the next place oblige it to control itself.::James Madison
Americans have the right and advantage of being armed - unlike the citizens of other countries whose governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.::James Madison
The class of citizens who provide at once their own food and their own raiment, may be viewed as the most truly independent and happy.::James Madison
Where an excess of power prevails, property of no sort is duly respected. No man is safe in his opinions, his person, his faculties, or his possessions.::James Madison
All men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree.::James Madison
Learned Institutions ought to be favorite objects with every free people. They throw that light over the public mind which is the best security against crafty and dangerous encroachments on the public liberty.::James Madison
The people are the only legitimate fountain of power, and it is from them that the constitutional charter, under which the several branches of government hold their power, is derived.::James Madison
The frontiers of knowledge in the various fields of our subject are expanding at such a rate that, work as hard as one can, one finds oneself further and further away from an understanding of the whole.::James Meade
And, as I have said, it's made me think twice about the imagination. If the spirits aren't external, how astonishing the mediums become! Victor Hugo said of his voices that they were like his own mental powers multiplied by five.::James Merrill
Strange about parents. We have such easy access to them and such daunting problems of communication.::James Merrill
The best form of government is that which is most likely to prevent the greatest sum of evil.::James Monroe
The great increase of our population throughout the Union will alone produce an important effect, and in no quarter will it be so sensibly felt as in those in contemplation.::James Monroe
I am sure that no man can derive more pleasure from money or power than I do from seeing a pair of basketball goals in some out of the way place.::James Naismith
But my most favourite pursuit, after my daily exertions at the Foundry, was Astronomy. There were frequently clear nights when the glorious objects in the Heavens were seen in most attractive beauty and brilliancy.::James Nasmyth
OUR history begins before we are born. We represent the hereditary influences of our race, and our ancestors virtually live in us.::James Nasmyth
Remote villages and communities have lost their identity, and their peace and charm have been sacrificed to that worst of abominations, the automobile.::James Norman Hall
Learned men are the cisterns of knowledge, not the fountainheads.::James Northcote
In England, literary pretence is more universal than elsewhere from our method of education.::James Payn
How large and varied is the educational bill of fare set before every young gentleman in Great Britain and to judge by the mental stamina it affords him in most cases, what a waste of good food it is!::James Payn
And what holds good of verse holds infinitely better in respect to prose.::James Payn
For my part, I do not feel that the scheme of future happiness, which ought by rights to be in preparation for me, will be at all interfered with by my not meeting again the man I have in my. mind.::James Payn
After the knowledge of, and obedience to, the will of God, the next aim must be to know something of His attributes of wisdom, power, and goodness as evidenced by His handiwork.::James Prescott Joule
Some people suggest that the problem is the separation of powers. If you had a parliamentary system, the struggle for power would not result in such complex peace treaties that empower so many different people to pursue so many contradictory aims.::James Q. Wilson
But no one has yet succeeded in reducing the size or scope of the federal government.::James Q. Wilson
The only difference is that religion is much better organised and has been around much longer, but it's the same story with different characters and different costumes.::James Randi
A government is the only vessel that leaks from the top.::James Reston
It is really quite amazing that all of the folks supporting privatization, from the president on down, keep invoking the name of my grandfather, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.::James Roosevelt
Whatever ought to be, can be.::James Rouse
For many years, I have lived uncomfortably with the belief that most planning and architectural design suffers for lack of real and basic purpose. The ultimate purpose, it seems to me, must be the improvement of mankind.::James Rouse
Democracy gives every man the right to be his own oppressor.::James Russell Lowell
As life runs on, the road grows strange with faces new - and near the end. The milestones into headstones change, Neath every one a friend.::James Russell Lowell
Usually when people are sad, they don't do anything. They just cry over their condition. But when they get angry, they bring about a change.::James Russell Lowell
Poetry is something to make us wiser and better, by continually revealing those types of beauty and truth, which God has set in all men's souls.::James Russell Lowell
Every person born into this world their work is born with them.::James Russell Lowell
Democracy is the form of government that gives every man the right to be his own oppressor.::James Russell Lowell

Not failure, but low aim, is crime.::James Russell Lowell
Light is the symbol of truth.::James Russell Lowell
One thorn of experience is worth a whole wilderness of warning.::James Russell Lowell

The greatest homage we can pay to truth, is to use it.::James Russell Lowell

Solitude is as needful to the imagination as society is wholesome for the character.::James Russell Lowell
On one issue at least, men and women agree they both distrust women.::James Russell Lowell
Truth, after all, wears a different face to everybody, and it would be too tedious to wait till all were agreed.::James Russell Lowell

Well, if this is poetry, I'm certainly never going to write any myself.::James Schuyler
You just can't get too focused on worrying about what's going to happen in the next quarter. You have to worry about where the business is headed long-term.::James Sinegal
It is in his knowledge that man has found his greatness and his happiness, the high superiority which he holds over the other animals who inhabit the earth with him, and consequently no ignorance is probably without loss to him, no error without evil.::James Smithson
It was amazing that a play that seems dated in this world... A man whose best friend is a six-foot white rabbit... But it caught on, especially with young people - they surprised me most of all.::James Stewart
I was going to be an architect. I graduated with a degree in architecture and I had a scholarship to go back to Princeton and get my Masters in architecture. I'd done theatricals in college, but I'd done them because it was fun.::James Stewart
Well, I think one of the main things that you have to think about when acting in the movies is to try not to make the acting show.::James Stewart

Let us not look back in anger, nor forward in fear, but around in awareness.::James Thurber
Man has gone long enough, or even too long, without being man enough to face the simple truth that the trouble with man is man.::James Thurber
All men should strive to learn before they die, what they are running from, and to, and why.::James Thurber

Women are wiser than men because they know less and understand more.::James Thurber
The most dangerous food is wedding cake.::James Thurber
The appreciative smile, the chuckle, the soundless mirth, so important to the success of comedy, cannot be understood unless one sits among the audience and feels the warmth created by the quality of laughter that the audience takes home with it.::James Thurber
Progress was all right. Only it went on too long.::James Thurber
The wit makes fun of other persons the satirist makes fun of the world the humorist makes fun of himself, but in so doing, he identifies himself with people - that is, people everywhere, not for the purpose of taking them apart, but simply revealing their true nature.::James Thurber
Love is what you've been through with somebody.::James Thurber
Well, if I called the wrong number, why did you answer the phone?::James Thurber
I'm 65 and I guess that puts me in with the geriatrics. But if there were fifteen months in every year, I'd only be 48. That's the trouble with us. We number everything. Take women, for example. I think they deserve to have more than twelve years between the ages of 28 and 40.::James Thurber
Comedy has to be done en clair. You can't blunt the edge of wit or the point of satire with obscurity. Try to imagine a famous witty saying that is not immediately clear.::James Thurber
I think that maybe if women and children were in charge we would get somewhere.::James Thurber
The nation that complacently and fearfully allows its artists and writers to become suspected rather than respected is no longer regarded as a nation possessed with humor or depth.::James Thurber
The animals that depend on instinct have an inherent knowledge of the laws of economics and of how to apply them Man, with his powers of reason, has reduced economics to the level of a farce which is at once funnier and more tragic than Tobacco Road.::James Thurber
After the United States entered the war, I joined the Naval Reserve and spent ninety days in a Columbia University dormitory learning to be a naval officer.::James Tobin
My father also happened to be an intellectual, as learned, literate, informed, and curious as anyone I have known. Unobtrusively and casually, he was my wise and gentle teacher.::James Tobin
Yale places great stress on undergraduate and graduate teaching. I like teaching, and I do a lot of it.::James Tobin
The greatest discovery of my generation is that man can alter his life simply by altering his attitude of mind.::James Truslow Adams
The freedom now desired by many is not freedom to do and dare but freedom from care and worry.::James Truslow Adams
Seek out that particular mental attribute which makes you feel most deeply and vitally alive, along with which comes the inner voice which says, 'This is the real me,' and when you have found that attitude, follow it.::James Truslow Adams
There is so much good in the worst of us, and so much bad in the best of us, that it ill behaves any of us to find fault with the rest of us.::James Truslow Adams
Age acquires no value save through thought and discipline.::James Truslow Adams
Happiness is perfume, you can't pour it on somebody else without getting a few drops on yourself.::James Van Der Zee

I thought of Paris as a beauty spot on the face of the earth, and of London as a big freckle.::James Weldon Johnson
The peculiar fascination which the South held over my imagination and my limited capital decided me in favor of Atlanta University so about the last of September I bade farewell to the friends and scenes of my boyhood and boarded a train for the South.::James Weldon Johnson
The battle was first waged over the right of the Negro to be classed as a human being with a soul later, as to whether he had sufficient intellect to master even the rudiments of learning and today it is being fought out over his social recognition.::James Weldon Johnson
When you awaken some morning and hear that somebody or other has been discovered, you can put it down as a fact that he discovered himself years ago - since that time he has been toiling, working, and striving to make himself worthy of general discovery.::James Whitcomb Riley
The anger of a person who is strong, can always bide its time.::James Whitcomb Riley

When the show is over we still have to pay our rent, we have to buy food. We have to do all the same things that you do.::Jamie Farr

Travel, which was once either a necessity or an adventure, has become very largely a commodity, and from all sides we are persuaded into thinking that it is a social requirement, too.::Jan Morris
Civilization is a method of living, an attitude of equal respect for all men.::Jane Addams
Unless our conception of patriotism is progressive, it cannot hope to embody the real affection and the real interest of the nation.::Jane Addams
America's future will be determined by the home and the school. The child becomes largely what he is taught hence we must watch what we teach, and how we live.::Jane Addams
There is nothing like staying at home for real comfort.::Jane Austen
One man's ways may be as good as another's, but we all like our own best.::Jane Austen
Single women have a dreadful propensity for being poor. Which is one very strong argument in favor of matrimony.::Jane Austen
To sit in the shade on a fine day and look upon verdure is the most perfect refreshment.::Jane Austen
Seldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human disclosure seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised, or a little mistaken.::Jane Austen
Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story. Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree the pen has been in their hands. I will not allow books to prove anything.::Jane Austen
A large income is the best recipe for happiness I ever heard of.::Jane Austen
Selfishness must always be forgiven you know, because there is no hope of a cure.::Jane Austen
Good-humoured, unaffected girls, will not do for a man who has been used to sensible women. They are two distinct orders of being.::Jane Austen
Respect for right conduct is felt by every body.::Jane Austen
Friendship is certainly the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love.::Jane Austen
We do not look in our great cities for our best morality.::Jane Austen

Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.::Jane Austen
Business, you know, may bring you money, but friendship hardly ever does.::Jane Austen
Human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting situations, that a young person, who either marries or dies, is sure of being kindly spoken of.::Jane Austen
From politics, it was an easy step to silence.::Jane Austen
Woman is fine for her own satisfaction alone. No man will admire her the more, no woman will like her the better for it. Neatness and fashion are enough for the former, and a something of shabbiness or impropriety will be most endearing to the latter.::Jane Austen
Give a girl an education and introduce her properly into the world, and ten to one but she has the means of settling well, without further expense to anybody.::Jane Austen
A lady's imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment.::Jane Austen

My idea of good company is the company of clever, well-informed people who have a great deal of conversation that is what I call good company.::Jane Austen
There are certainly not so many men of large fortune in the world, as there are pretty women to deserve them.::Jane Austen
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.::Jane Austen
The shortest period of time lies between the minute you put some money away for a rainy day and the unexpected arrival of rain.::Jane Bryant Quinn
As I visited the various neighborhoods in the campaign, I learned fast that it's a mistake to think that all of the wisdom and possible solutions to our problems are available only in this building.::Jane Byrne
Our universities and museums are respected around the country.::Jane Byrne
Chicago's neighborhoods have always been this city's greatest strength.::Jane Byrne
If the career you have chosen has some unexpected inconvenience, console yourself by reflecting that no career is without them.::Jane Fonda
I took every chance I could to meet with U.S. soldiers. I talked with them and read the books they gave me about the war. I decided I needed to return to my country and join with them - active duty soldiers and Vietnam Veterans in particular - to try and end the war.::Jane Fonda
If we as a nation are to break the cycle of poverty, crime and the growing underclass of young people ill equipped to be productive citizens, we need to not only implement effective programs to prevent teen pregnancy, but we must also help those who have already given birth so that they become effective, nurturing, bonding parents.::Jane Fonda
Our youth deserve the opportunity to complete their high school and college education, free of early parenthood. Their future children deserve the opportunity to grow up in financially and emotionally stable homes. Our communities benefit from healthy, productive, well-prepared young people.::Jane Fonda
We can no longer waste time and money. Every day, more than 2,000 girls in America, age 15-19, give birth - in the wealthiest, most educated nation in the world! Neither you nor I should accept this statistic.::Jane Fonda
I don't think there's anything more important than making peace before it's too late. And it almost always falls to the child to try to move toward the parent.::Jane Fonda
I feel like my honesty gives people the freedom to talk about things they wouldn't otherwise.::Jane Fonda
We're still living with the old paradigm of age as an arch. That's the old metaphor: You're born, you peak at midlife and decline into decrepitude.::Jane Fonda
It's hard for women at my age in Hollywood, but I'm not discouraged.::Jane Fonda
Children born to teens have less supportive and stimulating environments, poorer health, lower cognitive development, and worse educational outcomes. Children of teen mothers are at increased risk of being in foster care and becoming teen parents themselves, thereby repeating the cycle.::Jane Fonda
I'm a very brave person. I can go to North Vietnam, I can challenge my government, but I can't challenge the man I'm with if means I'm going to end up alone.::Jane Fonda
If adolescent pregnancy prevention is to become a priority, then our strategy, as advocates, must contain two key elements: civic engagement and education.::Jane Fonda
My mother killed herself when I was 12. I won't complete that relationship. But I can try to understand her.::Jane Fonda
The reality is sobering: in the United States one in three girls will become pregnant before age 20, totaling more than 750,000 girls per year.::Jane Fonda
It's about time we make the well-being of our young people more important than ideology and politics. As a country, we benefit from investing in their future by investing in teen pregnancy prevention.::Jane Fonda
Think about it: Reducing crime and poverty and ensuring that we have an educated, stable work force has a direct effect on you and me and the future of our country.::Jane Fonda
My childhood was influenced by the roles my father played in his movies. Whether Abraham Lincoln or Tom Joad in the 'Grapes of Wrath,' his characters communicated certain values which I try to carry with me to this day.::Jane Fonda
One part of wisdom is knowing what you don't need anymore and letting it go.::Jane Fonda
I remember saying goodbye to my father the night he left to join the Navy. He didn't have to. He was older than other servicemen and had a family to support but he wanted to be a part of the fight against fascism, not just make movies about it. I admired this about him.::Jane Fonda
While not impossible, it is especially challenging for teenage parents to develop bonds with their children. A high percent of them were themselves children of teenage parents and have never experienced appropriate parenting.::Jane Fonda
I thought my life was mapped out. Research, living in the forest, teaching and writing. But in '86 I went to a conference and realised the chimpanzees were disappearing. I had worldwide recognition and a gift of communication. I had to use them.::Jane Goodall
Words can be said in bitterness and anger, and often there seems to be an element of truth in the nastiness. And words don't go away, they just echo around.::Jane Goodall
When I began in 1960, individuality wasn't an accepted thing to look for it was about species-specific behaviour. But animal behaviour is not hard science. There's room for intuition.::Jane Goodall
My family has very strong women. My mother never laughed at my dream of Africa, even though everyone else did because we didn't have any money, because Africa was the 'dark continent', and because I was a girl.::Jane Goodall
But does that mean that war and violence are inevitable? I would argue not because we have also evolved this amazingly sophisticated intellect, and we are capable of controlling our innate behavior a lot of the time.::Jane Goodall
Women tend to be more intuitive, or to admit to being intuitive, and maybe the hard science approach isn't so attractive. The way that science is taught is very cold. I would never have become a scientist if I had been taught like that.::Jane Goodall
Change happens by listening and then starting a dialogue with the people who are doing something you don't believe is right.::Jane Goodall
I'm always pushing for human responsibility. Given that chimpanzees and many other animals are sentient and sapient, then we should treat them with respect.::Jane Goodall
When I look back over my life it's almost as if there was a plan laid out for me - from the little girl who was so passionate about animals who longed to go to Africa and whose family couldn't afford to put her through college. Everyone laughed at my dreams. I was supposed to be a secretary in Bournemouth.::Jane Goodall
I'm highly political. I spend an awful lot of time in the U.S. trying to influence decision-makers. But I don't feel in tune with British politics.::Jane Goodall
War had always seemed to me to be a purely human behavior. Accounts of warlike behavior date back to the very first written records of human history it seemed to be an almost universal characteristic of human groups.::Jane Goodall
Design is people.::Jane Jacobs
Imparting knowledge is only lighting other men's candles at our lamp without depriving ourselves of any flame.::Jane Porter
Happiness is a sunbeam which may pass through a thousand bosoms without losing a particle of its original ray nay, when it strikes on a kindred heart, like the converged light on a mirror, it reflects itself with redoubled brightness. It is not perfected till it is shared.::Jane Porter
Dr. Johnson has said that the chief glory of a country arises from its authors. But then that is only as they are oracles of wisdom unless they teach virtue, they are more worthy of a halter than of the laurel.::Jane Porter
Dreams can be like charades in which we act out words rather than see or speak them.::Jane Roberts
The channels of intuitive knowledge are opened according to the intensity of individual need.::Jane Roberts
Dreaming or awake, we perceive only events that have meaning to us.::Jane Roberts
You should tell yourself frequently 'I will only react to constructive suggestions.' This gives you positive ammunition against your own negative thoughts and those of others.::Jane Roberts
I believe only in art and failure.::Jane Rule
The message of women's liberation is that women can love each other and ourselves against our degrading education.::Jane Rule
Even though I make those movies, I find myself wishing that more of those magic moments could happen in real life.::Jane Seymour
You cannot do everything at once, so find people you trust to help you. And don't be afraid to say no.::Jane Seymour
People ask me how I keep my figure, and I tell them it's because I paint. When you're covered in paint, it's quite hard to put food in your mouth!::Jane Seymour
It's interesting that whenever I meet some of the other Bond girls, I always have something in common, and it is an interesting sorority. We all share about our Bonds. 'Did your Bond do that?' 'Yes mine did!' So it is quite funny conversations. We may as well be in high school.::Jane Seymour
No, I chose the name Jane Seymour because I was doing my first film, 'Ode to Lovely War,' and one of the top agents in England spotted me dancing in the chorus. I was a singer and dancer in that movie with Maggie Smith, um, and he told me he couldn't sell me as Joyce Penelope Willomena Frankenburger.::Jane Seymour
It's interesting because a lot of my 16-year-old kids' friends know me from 'Wedding Crashers,' and not so much Bond. My kids have a good laugh. I was 20 then. The look I had then was the look that a lot of their friends are assuming now. They think it's cool. What goes around comes around.::Jane Seymour
My mother lived in Holland, and during World War II was incarcerated in a Japanese camp for three years.::Jane Seymour
People say women shouldn't have long hair over a certain age, but I've never done what everyone says.::Jane Seymour
I really love the independent movies and I just think that sometimes when they throw a lot of money into it and a lot of special effects and a lot of stunts that you lose the connection, the human connection and I personally love movies that are about the human connection.::Jane Seymour
When I auditioned for 'Wedding Crashers,' the producers had never seen any of my other work except for Bond. I got 'Wedding Crashers' partly because I was a Bond girl.::Jane Seymour
I had ordered long legs, but they never arrived. My eyes are weird too, one is gray and the other is green. I have a crooked smile and my nose looks like a ski slope. No, I would not win a Miss contest.::Jane Seymour
I'm not involved in the politics of religion, but I love what the message is.::Jane Seymour
I learn my lines while on the golf course. I try to do two or three things at once. I have ideas for books all the time, I have ideas for paintings all the time, and I write them all down. I take my sketchpad and my iPad, which I design on, and I do sit down and do specific tasks at specific times.::Jane Seymour
I love doing comedy. Absolutely love it. After 'Wedding Crashers,' people suddenly realized that it was something I could do.::Jane Seymour
I've had two terrific relationships, but both ended in marriage.::Jane Seymour
I think a lot of people get so obsessed with the wedding and the expense of the wedding that they miss out on what the real purpose is. It's not about a production number, it's about a meaningful moment between two people that's witnessed by people that they actually really know and care about.::Jane Seymour
I believe that there is some spiritual entity that's greater than us. I do not belong to any specific organized religion. I have always believed that, and I believe it even more so now. I believe that someone was listening to me, and someone is giving me an incredibly blessed life.::Jane Seymour
I spend my afternoons painting and working on my Open Hearts jewelry line for Kay Jewelers. I designed an image of a heart that isn't completely closed. My mom always told me to live with an open heart - when life gets tough, you should go out and help someone else.::Jane Seymour
Beauty is a radiance that originates from within and comes from inner security and strong character.::Jane Seymour
When we talk to God, we're praying. When God talks to us, we're schizophrenic.::Jane Wagner
The opportunity for brotherhood presents itself every time you meet a human being.::Jane Wyman
Writing a novel is not merely going on a shopping expedition across the border to an unreal land: it is hours and years spent in the factories, the streets, the cathedrals of the imagination.::Janet Frame
It would be nice to travel if you knew where you were going and where you would live at the end or do we ever know, do we ever live where we live, we're always in other places, lost, like sheep.::Janet Frame
At this moment I do not have a personal relationship with a computer.::Janet Reno
The good lawyer is the great salesman.::Janet Reno
I have been surrounded by some of the smartest, brightest, most caring lawyers, by agents who are willing to risk their lives for others, by support staff that are willing to work as hard as they can.::Janet Reno
We have initiated programs for re-entry offenders, since some 500,000 to 600,000 offenders will come out of prison each year for the next three or four years. We want to have positive alternatives when they come back to the community.::Janet Reno
Jews have had to carry around their own sense of self in a carpet bag and I think perhaps too much emphasis might be being put on nationality and on the other hand patriotism, that sort of thing.::Janet Suzman
Technology has to be invented or adopted.::Jared Diamond
The main thing that gives me hope is the media. We have radio, TV, magazines, and books, so we have the possibility of learning from societies that are remote from us, like Somalia. We turn on the TV and see what blew up in Iraq or we see conditions in Afghanistan.::Jared Diamond
Federal elections happen every two years in this country. Presidential elections every four years. And four years just isn't long enough to dismantle all the environmental laws we've got in this country.::Jared Diamond
Biology is the science. Evolution is the concept that makes biology unique.::Jared Diamond
Technology causes problems as well as solves problems. Nobody has figured out a way to ensure that, as of tomorrow, technology won't create problems. Technology simply means increased power, which is why we have the global problems we face today.::Jared Diamond
We're uncomfortable about considering history as a science. It's classified as a social science, which is considered not quite scientific.::Jared Diamond
Introspection and preserved writings give us far more insight into the ways of past humans than we have into the ways of past dinosaurs. For that reason, I'm optimistic that we can eventually arrive at convincing explanations for these broadest patterns of human history.::Jared Diamond
Tasmanian history is a study of human isolation unprecedented except in science fiction - namely, complete isolation from other humans for 10,000 years.::Jared Diamond
Thousands of years ago, humans domesticated every possible large wild mammal species fulfilling all those criteria and worth domesticating, with the result that there have been no valuable additions of domestic animals in recent times, despite the efforts of modern science.::Jared Diamond
I've worked very hard in this book to keep the lines of communication open. I don't want to turn someone away from this information for partisan political reasons.::Jared Diamond
When something is new to us, we treat it as an experience. We feel that our senses are awake and clear. We are alive.::Jasper Johns
As one gets older one sees many more paths that could be taken. Artists sense within their own work that kind of swelling of possibilities, which may seem a freedom or a confusion.::Jasper Johns
The forces in a capitalist society, if left unchecked, tend to make the rich richer and the poor poorer.::Jawaharlal Nehru
You don't change the course of history by turning the faces of portraits to the wall.::Jawaharlal Nehru
I have become a queer mixture of the East and the West, out of place everywhere, at home nowhere.::Jawaharlal Nehru
Without peace, all other dreams vanish and are reduced to ashes.::Jawaharlal Nehru
Failure comes only when we forget our ideals and objectives and principles.::Jawaharlal Nehru
The purely agitational attitude is not good enough for a detailed consideration of a subject.::Jawaharlal Nehru
A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new when an age ends and when the soul of a nation long suppressed finds utterance.::Jawaharlal Nehru
Peace is not a relationship of nations. It is a condition of mind brought about by a serenity of soul. Peace is not merely the absence of war. It is also a state of mind. Lasting peace can come only to peaceful people.::Jawaharlal Nehru
There is perhaps nothing so bad and so dangerous in life as fear.::Jawaharlal Nehru
The man who has gotten everything he wants is all in favor of peace and order.::Jawaharlal Nehru
Let us be a little humble let us think that the truth may not perhaps be entirely with us.::Jawaharlal Nehru
Ignorance is always afraid of change.::Jawaharlal Nehru
We live in a wonderful world that is full of beauty, charm and adventure. There is no end to the adventures that we can have if only we seek them with our eyes open.::Jawaharlal Nehru
Time is not measured by the passing of years but by what one does, what one feels, and what one achieves.::Jawaharlal Nehru
We ought to be beating our chests every day. We ought to look in the mirror, stick out our chests, suck in our bellies, and say, 'Damn, we're Americans,' and smile.::Jay Garner
Pat Roberts and I both feel very strongly that when we get to Iran, that we can't make the same mistakes. We have to ask the questions, the hard questions before, not afterwards, and get the right intelligence.::Jay Rockefeller
You gotta have a body.::Jayne Mansfield
Marriage, even the best marriages are tough.::Jayne Meadows
My mother was the dearest, sweetest angel. She didn't talk she sang. She was a tower of strength.::Jayne Meadows
Beauty is one of the rare things which does not lead to doubt of God.::Jean Anouilh
We poison our lives with fear of burglary and shipwreck, and, ask anyone, the house is never burgled, and the ship never goes down.::Jean Anouilh
Life is a wonderful thing to talk about, or to read about in history books - but it is terrible when one has to live it.::Jean Anouilh
Are you in earnest? Seize this very minute! Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. Only engage, and then the mind grows heated. Begin, and then the work will be completed.::Jean Anouilh
It takes a certain courage and a certain greatness to be truly base.::Jean Anouilh
To say yes, you have to sweat and roll up your sleeves and plunge both hands into life up to the elbows. It is easy to say no, even if saying no means death.::Jean Anouilh
Nothing is irreparable in politics.::Jean Anouilh
Things are beautiful if you love them.::Jean Anouilh
Until the day of his death, no man can be sure of his courage.::Jean Anouilh
Life is very nice, but it lacks form. It's the aim of art to give it some.::Jean Anouilh
Tragedy is restful: and the reason is that hope, that foul, deceitful thing, has no part in it.::Jean Anouilh
Men create real miracles when they use their God-given courage and intelligence.::Jean Anouilh
Some men like to make a little garden out of life and walk down a path.::Jean Anouilh
One cannot weep for the entire world, it is beyond human strength. One must choose.::Jean Anouilh
Our entire life - consists ultimately in accepting ourselves as we are.::Jean Anouilh
An ugly sight, a man who is afraid.::Jean Anouilh
Soon silence will have passed into legend. Man has turned his back on silence. Day after day he invents machines and devices that increase noise and distract humanity from the essence of life, contemplation, meditation.::Jean Arp
There is nothing funny about Halloween. This sarcastic festival reflects, rather, an infernal demand for revenge by children on the adult world.::Jean Baudrillard
The sad thing about artificial intelligence is that it lacks artifice and therefore intelligence.::Jean Baudrillard
A negative judgment gives you more satisfaction than praise, provided it smacks of jealousy.::Jean Baudrillard
Television knows no night. It is perpetual day. TV embodies our fear of the dark, of night, of the other side of things.::Jean Baudrillard
I hesitate to deposit money in a bank. I am afraid I shall never dare to take it out again. When you go to confession and entrust your sins to the safe-keeping of the priest, do you ever come back for them?::Jean Baudrillard
The great person is ahead of their time, the smart make something out of it, and the blockhead, sets themselves against it.::Jean Baudrillard
Deep down, no one really believes they have a right to live. But this death sentence generally stays tucked away, hidden beneath the difficulty of living. If that difficulty is removed from time to time, death is suddenly there, unintelligibly.::Jean Baudrillard
Deep down, the US, with its space, its technological refinement, its bluff good conscience, even in those spaces which it opens up for simulation, is the only remaining primitive society.::Jean Baudrillard
To love someone is to isolate him from the world, wipe out every trace of him, dispossess him of his shadow, drag him into a murderous future. It is to circle around the other like a dead star and absorb him into a black light.::Jean Baudrillard
What is a society without a heroic dimension?::Jean Baudrillard
Cowardice and courage are never without a measure of affectation. Nor is love. Feelings are never true. They play with their mirrors.::Jean Baudrillard
In the same way that we need statesmen to spare us the abjection of exercising power, we need scholars to spare us the abjection of learning.::Jean Baudrillard
Like dreams, statistics are a form of wish fulfillment.::Jean Baudrillard
The study of history is the beginning of political wisdom.::Jean Bodin
All good music resembles something. Good music stirs by its mysterious resemblance to the objects and feelings which motivated it.::Jean Cocteau
Everything one does in life, even love, occurs in an express train racing toward death. To smoke opium is to get out of the train while it is still moving. It is to concern oneself with something other than life or death.::Jean Cocteau
Here I am trying to live, or rather, I am trying to teach the death within me how to live.::Jean Cocteau
The reward of art is not fame or success but intoxication: that is why so many bad artists are unable to give it up.::Jean Cocteau
Art is not a pastime but a priesthood.::Jean Cocteau
Children and lunatics cut the Gordian knot which the poet spends his life patiently trying to untie.::Jean Cocteau

There is an absolutely fundamental hostility on the part of totalitarian regimes toward religion.::Jeane Kirkpatrick
We have war when at least one of the parties to a conflict wants something more than it wants peace.::Jeane Kirkpatrick

You can no more win a war than you can win an earthquake.::Jeannette Rankin
Pick up a rifle and you change instantly from a subject to a citizen.::Jeff Cooper

All we ask is to be let alone.::Jefferson Davis
Neither current events nor history show that the majority rule, or ever did rule.::Jefferson Davis
I worked night and day for twelve years to prevent the war, but I could not. The North was mad and blind, would not let us govern ourselves, and so the war came.::Jefferson Davis

Marriage is the mother of the world. It preserves kingdoms, and fills cities and churches, and heaven itself.::Jeremy Taylor
To be proud of learning is the greatest ignorance.::Jeremy Taylor
It is impossible to make people understand their ignorance, for it requires knowledge to perceive it and, therefore, he that can perceive it hath it not.::Jeremy Taylor
Secrecy is the chastity of friendship.::Jeremy Taylor
A celibate, like the fly in the heart of an apple, dwells in a perpetual sweetness, but sits alone, and is confined and dies in singularity.::Jeremy Taylor

Education must, be not only a transmission of culture but also a provider of alternative views of the world and a strengthener of the will to explore them.::Jerome Bruner
It is a wise man who knows where courage ends and stupidity begins.::Jerome Cady
I attribute the quarrelsome nature of the Middle Ages young men entirely to the want of the soothing weed.::Jerome K. Jerome
I can see the humorous side of things and enjoy the fun when it comes but look where I will, there seems to me always more sadness than joy in life.::Jerome K. Jerome

I like work it fascinates me. I can sit and look at it for hours.::Jerome K. Jerome
The weather is like the government, always in the wrong.::Jerome K. Jerome
It is in our faults and failings, not in our virtues, that we touch each other, and find sympathy. It is in our follies that we are one.::Jerome K. Jerome
You must not demand the failure of your peers, because the more good things that are around in film, in television, in theater - why the better it is for all of us.::Jerome Lawrence
It's always such a joy that you wake up in the morning and there's work to do.::Jerome Lawrence
It looks to me to be obvious that the whole world cannot eat an American diet.::Jerry Brown
When the farmer can sell directly to the consumer, it is a more active process. There's more contact. The consumer can know, who am I buying this from? What's their name? Do they have a face? Is the food they are selling coming out of Mexico with pesticides?::Jerry Brown
We have to restore power to the family, to the neighborhood, and the community with a non-market principle, a principle of equality, of charity, of let's-take-care-of-one-another. That's the creative challenge.::Jerry Brown
I like computers. I like the Internet. It's a tool that can be used. But don't be misled into thinking that these technologies are anything other than aspects of a degenerate economic system.::Jerry Brown
Jobs for every American is doomed to failure because of modern automation and production. We ought to recognize it and create an income-maintenance system so every single American has the dignity and the wherewithal for shelter, basic food, and medical care. I'm talking about welfare for all. Without it, you're going to have warfare for all.::Jerry Brown
Automation and technology would be a great boon if it were creative, if there were more leisure, more opportunity to engage in raising a family, providing guidance to the young, all the stuff we say we need. America will work if we're all in it together. It'll work when there's a shared sense of destiny. It can be done!::Jerry Brown
We will see a breakdown of the family and family values if we decide to approve same-sex marriage, and if we decide to establish homosexuality as an acceptable alternative lifestyle with all the benefits that go with equating it with the heterosexual lifestyle.::Jerry Falwell
God created the family to provide the maximum love and support and morality and example that one can imagine.::Jerry Falwell

College was especially sweet because of the positive, hopeful atmosphere of a college campus.::Jerry Kramer
I've had the greatest respect for my work in this country by Americans. Critics have no brains.::Jerry Lewis
I have a loyalty that runs in my bloodstream, when I lock into someone or something, you can't get me away from it because I commit that thoroughly. That's in friendship, that's a deal, that's a commitment. Don't give me paper - I can get the same lawyer who drew it up to break it. But if you shake my hand, that's for life.::Jerry Lewis
I never got a formal education. So my intellect is my common sense. I don't have anything else going for me. And my common sense opens the door to instinct.::Jerry Lewis
I turned down 'Some Like It Hot.' See how smart I am? I felt I couldn't bring anything funny to it. The outfit was funny. I don't need to compete with the wardrobe.::Jerry Lewis
I've had great success being a total idiot.::Jerry Lewis
Every man's dream is to be able to sink into the arms of a woman without also falling into her hands.::Jerry Lewis
I am probably the most selfish man you will ever meet in your life. No one gets the satisfaction or the joy that I get out of seeing kids realize there is hope.::Jerry Lewis
People hate me because I am a multifaceted, talented, wealthy, internationally famous genius.::Jerry Lewis
If you're an old pro, you know how well you're doing when you're doing it, and your inner government spanks you if you're not doing well.::Jerry Lewis
I have some very personal feelings about politics, but I don't get into it because I do comedy already.::Jerry Lewis
'Home Alone' was a movie, not an alibi.::Jerry Orbach
We do a hard fantasy as well as hard science fiction, and I think I probably single-handedly recreated military science fiction. It was dead before I started working in it.::Jerry Pournelle
I started in this racket in the early '70s, and when I was president of the Science Fiction Writers of America, of which I was like the sixth president, I was the first one nobody ever heard of.::Jerry Pournelle
I have spent over 60 years bent over a guitar and to know that I wrote 70 compositions that masters have recorded, that makes me feel so good and full, and proud and thankful to the good Lord.::Jerry Reed
Pray for intestinal fortitude, work hard, and keep the faith. Oh, and pray for good luck, you're gonna need it.::Jerry Reed
The power to define the situation is the ultimate power.::Jerry Rubin
Don't trust anyone over thirty.::Jerry Rubin
I'm famous. That's my job.::Jerry Rubin
It can make you sad to look at pictures from your youth. So there's a trick to it. The trick is not to look at the later pictures.::Jerry Stiller
During the Great Depression, when people laughed their worries disappeared. Audiences loved these funny men. I decided to become one.::Jerry Stiller
I don't think my judgment is that good. I don't know what is funny.::Jerry Stiller
We managed to hang in there. Today when people get married there's a tendency to run away when things get tough. There is a lot of strength in hanging together.::Jerry Stiller
To be candid with you, free agency hurts all sports. It's great for athletes making an enormous amount of money. But to say it helps the sports, I don't believe that.::Jerry West
When it's time for me to walk away from something, I walk away from it. My mind, my body, my conscience tell me that enough is enough.::Jerry West
You can't get much done in life if you only work on the days when you feel good.::Jerry West
Such schemes take money from people who can least afford to spend it to support an unneeded bureaucracy that eats money people thought they were providing for education.::Jesse Helms
Conservatism is a hard choice for a society that has become accustomed to big government and big entitlements promoted by liberals.::Jesse Helms
I want our government to encourage and protect freedom as well as our traditions of faith and family.::Jesse Helms
I have tried at every point to seek God's wisdom on the decisions I made, and I made it my business to speak up on behalf of the things God tells us are important to Him.::Jesse Helms
That is why I fought against abortion and that is why if I were still in the Senate I would be doing everything I could to defend the sanctity of marriage.::Jesse Helms
I knew, however, that the next morning after the fight I would have to get away, and I did just in time, for a full company came early to look for me and were furious because I had escaped them.::Jesse James
We all have dreams. But in order to make dreams come into reality, it takes an awful lot of determination, dedication, self-discipline, and effort.::Jesse Owens
A lifetime of training for just ten seconds.::Jesse Owens
For a time, at least, I was the most famous person in the entire world.::Jesse Owens
Hitler and Mussolini were only the primary spokesmen for the attitude of domination and craving for power that are in the heart of almost everyone. Until the source is cleared, there will always be confusion and hate, wars and class antagonisms.::Jiddu Krishnamurti
In oneself lies the whole world and if you know how to look and learn, the door is there and the key is in your hand. Nobody on earth can give you either the key or the door to open, except yourself.::Jiddu Krishnamurti
It's no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.::Jiddu Krishnamurti
What is needed, rather than running away or controlling or suppressing or any other resistance, is understanding fear that means, watch it, learn about it, come directly into contact with it. We are to learn about fear, not how to escape from it.::Jiddu Krishnamurti
It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.::Jiddu Krishnamurti
Your belief in God is merely an escape from your monotonous, stupid and cruel life.::Jiddu Krishnamurti
The constant assertion of belief is an indication of fear.::Jiddu Krishnamurti
Freedom from the desire for an answer is essential to the understanding of a problem.::Jiddu Krishnamurti
You must understand the whole of life, not just one little part of it. That is why you must read, that is why you must look at the skies, that is why you must sing and dance, and write poems and suffer and understand, for all that is life.::Jiddu Krishnamurti
The moment you have in your heart this extraordinary thing called love and feel the depth, the delight, the ecstasy of it, you will discover that for you the world is transformed.::Jiddu Krishnamurti
I maintain that Truth is a pathless land, and you cannot approach it by any path whatsoever, by any religion, by any sect.::Jiddu Krishnamurti
Religion is the frozen thought of man out of which they build temples.::Jiddu Krishnamurti
A man who is not afraid is not aggressive, a man who has no sense of fear of any kind is really a free, a peaceful man.::Jiddu Krishnamurti
There is no end to education. It is not that you read a book, pass an examination, and finish with education. The whole of life, from the moment you are born to the moment you die, is a process of learning.::Jiddu Krishnamurti
We all want to be famous people, and the moment we want to be something we are no longer free.::Jiddu Krishnamurti
I have a theory that the secret of marital happiness is simple: drink in different pubs to your other half.::Jilly Cooper
Watching your daughter being collected by her date feels like handing over a million dollar Stradivarius to a gorilla.::Jim Bishop
When you read about a car crash in which two or three youngsters are killed, do you pause to dwell on the amount of love and treasure and patience parents poured into bodies no longer suitable for open caskets?::Jim Bishop
Golf is played by twenty million mature American men whose wives think they are out having fun.::Jim Bishop
A newspaper is lumber made malleable. It is ink made into words and pictures. It is conceived, born, grows up and dies of old age in a day.::Jim Bishop
It is difficult to live in the present, ridiculous to live in the future and impossible to live in the past. Nothing is as far away as one minute ago.::Jim Bishop
Baseball players are smarter than football players. How often do you see a baseball team penalized for too many men on the field?::Jim Bouton
You spend a good piece of your life gripping a baseball and in the end it turns out that it was the other way around all the time.::Jim Bouton
I'm not interested in trying to work on people's perceptions. I am who I am, and if you don't take the time to learn about that, then your perception is going to be your problem.::Jim Brown
I came from Long Island, so I had a lot of experience at the stick. I played in junior high school, then I played in high school. The technical aspect of the game was my forte. I had all that experience, then I had strength and I was in good condition.::Jim Brown
A loving family provides the foundation children need to succeed, and strong families with a man and a woman - bonded together for life - always have been, and always will be, the key to such families.::Jim Bunning
The activists will not stop in trying to impose their extreme views on the rest of us, and they have now plotted out a state-by-state strategy to increase the number of judicial decisions redefining marriage without the voice of the people being heard.::Jim Bunning
The Internet is not just one thing, it's a collection of things - of numerous communications networks that all speak the same digital language.::Jim Clark
I only travel to good material, a good director and a good company. I won't work in another country for a year any longer, because I have a lovely wife and I adore her and I can't bear to be away from her.::Jim Dale
You cannot learn anything from success, you only learn from failure.::Jim Dale
My attitude towards drawing is not necessarily about drawing. It's about making the best kind of image I can make, it's about talking as clearly as I can.::Jim Dine
God always gives His best to those who leave the choice with him.::Jim Elliot
The sound of 'gentle stillness' after all the thunder and wind have passed will the ultimate Word from God.::Jim Elliot
Grieve not, then, if your sons seem to desert you, but rejoice, rather, seeing the will of God done gladly.::Jim Elliot
It is true that a fellow cannot ignore women - but he can think of them as he ought - as sisters, not as sparring partners.::Jim Elliot
Most laws condemn the soul and pronounce sentence. The result of the law of my God is perfect. It condemns but forgives. It restores - more than abundantly - what it takes away.::Jim Elliot
Wherever you are - be all there.::Jim Elliot
Our challenge for the future is that we realize we are very much a part of the earth's ecosystem, and we must learn to respect and live according to the basic biological laws of nature.::Jim Fowler
The biggest challenge is how to affect public attitudes and make people care.::Jim Fowler
I don't think we're going to save anything if we go around talking about saving plants and animals only we've got to translate that into what's in it for us.::Jim Fowler
I derive no pleasure from prosecuting a man, even though I know he's guilty do you think I could sleep at night or look at myself in the mirror in the morning if I hounded an innocent man?::Jim Garrison
Until as recently as November of 1966, I had complete faith in the Warren Report. Of course, my faith in the Report was grounded in ignorance, since I had never read it.::Jim Garrison
It's rather naive, apart from being ethically objectionable, to assume that our investigators travel around the country with bags of money trying to bribe witnesses to lie on the witness stand. We just don't operate that way.::Jim Garrison
I'm afraid, based on my own experience, that fascism will come to America in the name of national security.::Jim Garrison
Some people hear their own inner voices with great clearness. And they live by what they hear. Such people become crazy... or they become legend.::Jim Harrison
I enjoy about 1 out of 100 movies, it's about the same proportion to books published that I care to read.::Jim Harrison
Everybody has a gun in their car in Detroit.::Jim Harrison
I used to get criticized for putting food in novels.::Jim Harrison
After a lifetime of world travel I've been fascinated that those in the third world don't have the same perception of reality that we do.::Jim Harrison
The old fun thing is when somebody typed up the first chapter of War and Peace. And then made a precis of the rest of it and sent it out and only one publisher recognized it.::Jim Harrison
I was very interested in theatre, mostly in stage design. I did a little bit of acting.::Jim Henson
And also there wasn't much money in television in those days anyhow.::Jim Henson
When I was young, my ambition was to be one of the people who made a difference in this world. My hope is to leave the world a little better for having been there.::Jim Henson
At the time of Polaroid - and I did a couple of other commercials just before I stopped doing that stuff - at that point I was at the level where they respect you and your opinion and all that sort of thing.::Jim Henson
Yeah, we pretty much had a form and a shape by that time - a style - and I think one of the advantages of not having any relationship to any other puppeteer was that it gave me a reason to put those together myself for the needs of television.::Jim Henson
At the University of Maryland, my first year I started off planning to major in art because I was interested in theatre design, stage design or television design.::Jim Henson
We thought it would be fun to try to design a show that would work well internationally and so that' s what we're intending to do with Fraggle Rock, and we are indeed now selling it around the world.::Jim Henson
Life's like a movie, write your own ending. Keep believing, keep pretending.::Jim Henson
My hope still is to leave the world a bit better than when I got here.::Jim Henson
We saw what happened in Jimmy Carter's administration. President Carter was a good man with the best of intentions. But he came to Washington without a good working relationship with Democratic members of Congress, which played a big part in his administration's problems.::Jim Hunt
Who knows what technology will emerge in the next five years, let alone 20. Yet the education we provide our children now is supposed to last for decades. We cannot train them for jobs that do not even exist yet, but we can provide them with the minds and tools they'll need to adapt to our ever-changing set of circumstances.::Jim Hunt
Teachers have the hardest and most important jobs in America. They're building our nation. And we should appreciate them, respect them, and pay them well.::Jim Hunt
In the depth of the near depression, that he faced when he came in, Barack Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress provided 'recovery funds' that literally kept our classrooms open. Two years ago, these funds saved nearly 20,000 teacher and education jobs - just here in North Carolina.::Jim Hunt
This Bush administration has a growing credibility gap, maybe even a credibility chasm, on environmental policy. The President has lost the trust of the American people when it comes to the environment.::Jim Jeffords
I have great faith in the intelligence of the American viewer and reader to put two and two together and come up with four.::Jim Lehrer
My Marine experience helped shape who I am now personally and professionally, and I am grateful for that on an almost daily basis.::Jim Lehrer
I've traveled around the country and I read local newspapers and all of that, and it's a sad, sad thing to go from city to city and see the small newspapers and they're tiny. They're tiny not only in size but also in scope.::Jim Lehrer
In my case, I was covering politics in Texas as a newspaper man in the 1960's.::Jim Lehrer
Most of the gaffes I've made have not been funny - they've been stupid.::Jim Lehrer
If you're a kid who's not necessarily attractive, and you don't have money, and you're not hip and cool, chances are you're not going to feel good about yourself and want to be an actor.::Jim McKay
I think Bob Costas is terrific. He's so knowledgeable. He can talk about any subject, not just sports.::Jim McKay
I studied secondary education.::Jim McKay
You must also give mental and physical fitness priority.::Jim Otto
Success is nothing more than a few simple disciplines, practiced every day.::Jim Rohn
The walls we build around us to keep sadness out also keeps out the joy.::Jim Rohn
Success is not to be pursued it is to be attracted by the person you become.::Jim Rohn
Success is steady progress toward one's personal goals.::Jim Rohn
The major value in life is not what you get. The major value in life is what you become.::Jim Rohn
Success is neither magical nor mysterious. Success is the natural consequence of consistently applying the basic fundamentals.::Jim Rohn
Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment.::Jim Rohn
Effective communication is 20% what you know and 80% how you feel about what you know.::Jim Rohn
Affirmation without discipline is the beginning of delusion.::Jim Rohn
Failure is simply a few errors in judgment, repeated every day.::Jim Rohn
Ideas can be life-changing. Sometimes all you need to open the door is just one more good idea.::Jim Rohn
Character isn't something you were born with and can't change, like your fingerprints. It's something you weren't born with and must take responsibility for forming.::Jim Rohn
Failure is not a single, cataclysmic event. You don't fail overnight. Instead, failure is a few errors in judgement, repeated every day.::Jim Rohn
Give whatever you are doing and whoever you are with the gift of your attention.::Jim Rohn
The reason that fiction is more interesting than any other form of literature, to those who really like to study people, is that in fiction the author can really tell the truth without humiliating himself.::Jim Rohn
Success is doing ordinary things extraordinarily well.::Jim Rohn
Don't bring your need to the marketplace, bring your skill. If you don't feel well, tell your doctor, but not the marketplace. If you need money, go to the bank, but not the marketplace.::Jim Rohn
Take advantage of every opportunity to practice your communication skills so that when important occasions arise, you will have the gift, the style, the sharpness, the clarity, and the emotions to affect other people.::Jim Rohn
Happiness is not something you postpone for the future it is something you design for the present.::Jim Rohn
Take care of your body. It's the only place you have to live.::Jim Rohn
Take time to gather up the past so that you will be able to draw from your experience and invest them in the future.::Jim Rohn
Whatever good things we build end up building us.::Jim Rohn
Either you run the day or the day runs you.::Jim Rohn
You cannot change your destination overnight, but you can change your direction overnight.::Jim Rohn
Whoever renders service to many puts himself in line for greatness - great wealth, great return, great satisfaction, great reputation, and great joy.::Jim Rohn
Part of your heritage in this society is the opportunity to become financially independent.::Jim Rohn
You must take personal responsibility. You cannot change the circumstances, the seasons, or the wind, but you can change yourself. That is something you have charge of.::Jim Rohn
If you don't like how things are, change it! You're not a tree.::Jim Rohn
Things that I felt absolutely sure of but a few years ago, I do not believe now. This thought makes me see more clearly how foolish it would be to expect all men to agree with me.::Jim Rohn
If you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you. If you go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you. Whatever good things we build end up building us.::Jim Rohn
Let others lead small lives, but not you. Let others argue over small things, but not you. Let others cry over small hurts, but not you. Let others leave their future in someone else's hands, but not you.::Jim Rohn
If you don't design your own life plan, chances are you'll fall into someone else's plan. And guess what they have planned for you? Not much.::Jim Rohn
A good objective of leadership is to help those who are doing poorly to do well and to help those who are doing well to do even better.::Jim Rohn
If someone is going down the wrong road, he doesn't need motivation to speed him up. What he needs is education to turn him around.::Jim Rohn
Words do two major things: They provide food for the mind and create light for understanding and awareness.::Jim Rohn
Work harder on yourself than you do on your job.::Jim Rohn
Make measurable progress in reasonable time.::Jim Rohn
Time is more value than money. You can get more money, but you cannot get more time.::Jim Rohn
Learning is the beginning of wealth. Learning is the beginning of health. Learning is the beginning of spirituality. Searching and learning is where the miracle process all begins.::Jim Rohn
Money is usually attracted, not pursued.::Jim Rohn
Formal education will make you a living self-education will make you a fortune.::Jim Rohn
Designed by architects with honorable intentions but hands of palsy.::Jimmy Breslin
Most people are really cool and I really don't mind talking to them and answering their questions.::Jimmy Carl Black
I would have told him that I appreciated his friendship through the years and that I had learned a lot from him. I really loved Frank like you do a brother.::Jimmy Carl Black
I don't want to tell President Obama how to make a speech. He's a much better speech maker than I am. But I think always to tell the truth in a sometimes blatant way, even though it might be temporarily unpopular, is the best approach.::Jimmy Carter
We cannot be both the world's leading champion of peace and the world's leading supplier of the weapons of war.::Jimmy Carter
When I was elected President nobody asked me to negotiate between Israel and Egypt. It was not even a question raised in my campaign. But I felt that one of the reasons that I was elected President was to try to bring peace to the Holy Land.::Jimmy Carter
We will not learn how to live together in peace by killing each other's children.::Jimmy Carter
It is good to realize that if love and peace can prevail on earth, and if we can teach our children to honor nature's gifts, the joys and beauties of the outdoors will be here forever.::Jimmy Carter
War may sometimes be a necessary evil. But no matter how necessary, it is always an evil, never a good. We will not learn how to live together in peace by killing each other's children.::Jimmy Carter
Government is a contrivance of human wisdom to provide for human wants. People have the right to expect that these wants will be provided for by this wisdom.::Jimmy Carter
I've looked on many women with lust. I've committed adultery in my heart many times. God knows I will do this and forgives me.::Jimmy Carter
Like music and art, love of nature is a common language that can transcend political or social boundaries.::Jimmy Carter
We become not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic. Different people, different beliefs, different yearnings, different hopes, different dreams.::Jimmy Carter
A fundamentalist can't bring himself or herself to negotiate with people who disagree with them because the negotiating process itself is an indication of implied equality.::Jimmy Carter
I separated from the Southern Baptists when they adopted the discriminatory attitude towards women, because I believe what Paul taught in Galatians that there is no distinction in God's eyes between men and women, slaves and masters, Jews and non-Jews - everybody is created equally in the eyes of God.::Jimmy Carter
We can't equate democracy with Christianity because the largest democracy on earth is India, which is primarily Hindu. The third largest democracy is Indonesia, which is Islamic. Democracy and freedom are not dependent on Christian beliefs.::Jimmy Carter
I don't claim to be knowledgeable about theology. Most of my knowledge comes out of my experience and the lessons in the Bible. Every Sunday I'm home I teach 45 minutes and we boiled them down to one page for the new book, 'Through the Year with Jimmy Carter.'::Jimmy Carter
When we go to the Bible we should keep in mind that the basic principles of the Bible are taught by God, but written down by human beings deprived of modern day knowledge. So there is some fallibility in the writings of the Bible. But the basic principles are applicable to my life and I don't find any conflict among them.::Jimmy Carter
My constant prayer, my number one foreign goal, is to bring peace to Israel. And in the process to Israel's neighbours.::Jimmy Carter
My decision to register women confirms what is already obvious throughout our society-that women are now providing all types of skills in every profession. The military should be no exception.::Jimmy Carter
In religious and in secular affairs, the more fervent beliefs attract followers. If you are a moderate in any respect - if you're a moderate on abortion, if you're a moderate on gun control, or if you're a moderate in your religious faith - it doesn't evolve into a crusade where you're either right or wrong, good or bad, with us or against us.::Jimmy Carter
The awareness that health is dependent upon habits that we control makes us the first generation in history that to a large extent determines its own destiny.::Jimmy Carter
If you fear making anyone mad, then you ultimately probe for the lowest common denominator of human achievement.::Jimmy Carter
The best way to enhance freedom in other lands is to demonstrate here that our democratic system is worthy of emulation.::Jimmy Carter
Globalization, as defined by rich people like us, is a very nice thing... you are talking about the Internet, you are talking about cell phones, you are talking about computers. This doesn't affect two-thirds of the people of the world.::Jimmy Carter
I think all Americans believe in human rights. And health is an often overlooked aspect of basic human rights. And it's one that's easily corrected. The reason I say that is that many of the diseases that we treat around the world, I knew when I was a child. My mother was a registered nurse. And they no longer exist in our country.::Jimmy Carter
I don't think that the total creation took place in six days as we now measure time. If we can confirm, say, the Big Bang theory, that doesn't at all cause me to question my faith that God created the Big Bang.::Jimmy Carter
When I was in the White House, I was confronted with the challenge of the Cold War. Both the Soviet Union and I had 30,000 nuclear weapons that could destroy the entire earth and I had to maintain the peace.::Jimmy Carter
Unfortunately, after Sept. 11, there was an outburst in America of intense suffering and patriotism, and the Bush administration was very shrewd and effective in painting anyone who disagreed with the policies as unpatriotic or even traitorous.::Jimmy Carter
It's very difficult for the American people to believe that our government, one of the richest on Earth, is also one of the stingiest on Earth.::Jimmy Carter
We must make it clear that a platform of 'I hate gay men and women' is not a way to become president of the United States.::Jimmy Carter
Because I know about the Holy Land, I've taught lessons about the Holy Land all my life, and - but you can't bring peace to Israel without giving the Palestinian also peace. And Lebanon and Jordan and Syria as well.::Jimmy Carter
You just have to have a simple faith.::Jimmy Carter
The Carter Center has the only existing international taskforce on disease eradication. Which means a total elimination of a disease on the face of the Earth. In the history of the world, there's only been one disease eradicated: smallpox. The second disease, I think, is gonna be guinea worm.::Jimmy Carter
I've just finished my 20th book this past year and I'm working on my 21st book about the Middle East right now that I'll finish this year. And I get up early in the morning and when I get tired of the computer and tired of doing research, I walk 20 steps out to my woodshop and I either build furniture or paint paintings. I'm an artist too.::Jimmy Carter
The fact is that we would have had comprehensive health care now, had it not been for Ted Kennedy's deliberately blocking the legislation that I proposed in 1978 or '79.::Jimmy Carter
Republicans are men of narrow vision, who are afraid of the future.::Jimmy Carter
There's no doubt that usually a president's public image is enhanced by going to war. That never did appeal to me.::Jimmy Carter
Ever since Israel has been a nation the United States has provided the leadership. Every president down to the ages has done this in a fairly balanced way, including George Bush senior, Gerald Ford, and others including myself and Bill Clinton.::Jimmy Carter
It's not necessary to fear the prospect of failure but to be determined not to fail.::Jimmy Carter
On balance, my life has been a constant stream of blessings rather than disappointments and failures and tragedies. I wish I had been re-elected. I think I could have kept our country at peace. I think I could have consolidated what we achieved at Camp David with a treaty between Israel and the Palestinians.::Jimmy Carter
In this outward and physical ceremony we attest once again to the inner and spiritual strength of our Nation. As my high school teacher, Miss Julia Coleman, used to say: 'We must adjust to changing times and still hold to unchanging principles.'::Jimmy Carter
I believe there is complete equality between men and women. And I believe those passages in the New Testament, not by Jesus, but by Paul, that say women should not adorn themselves, they should always wear hats or color their hair in church - things like that - I think they are signs of the times and should not apply to modern-day life.::Jimmy Carter
Testing oneself is best when done alone.::Jimmy Carter
I am confident that when the facts and policies have been examined, when the record of performances have been reviewed, Barack Obama and Joe Biden will once again be elected to lead our beloved country to a better future.::Jimmy Carter
I think there ought to be a strict separation or wall built between our religious faith and our practice of political authority in office. I don't think the President of the United States should extoll Christianity if he happens to be a Christian at the expense of Judaism, Islam or other faiths.::Jimmy Carter
For this generation, ours, life is nuclear survival, liberty is human rights, the pursuit of happiness is a planet whose resources are devoted to the physical and spiritual nourishment of its inhabitants.::Jimmy Carter
I had very good support from Democrats and Republicans all throughout my administration. I had a very high batting average. We added more jobs per year in my four years than any other president since the Second World War.::Jimmy Carter
The experience of democracy is like the experience of life itself-always changing, infinite in its variety, sometimes turbulent and all the more valuable for having been tested by adversity.::Jimmy Carter
I can't really criticize the Tea Party people, because I came into the White House pretty much on the same basis that they have become popular. That is dissatisfaction with the way things are going in Washington and disillusionment and disencouragement about the government.::Jimmy Carter
I can't change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination.::Jimmy Dean
God is bigger than people think.::Jimmy Dean
I've seen so many people in this business that made a fortune. They get old and broke and can't make any money. I tell you something... no one's going to play a benefit for Jimmy Dean.::Jimmy Dean
Poverty was the greatest motivating factor in my life.::Jimmy Dean
Why can't everybody leave everybody else the hell alone.::Jimmy Durante
My wife has a slight impediment in her speech. Every now and then she stops to breathe.::Jimmy Durante
I'm knocking our pitiful, pathetic lawmakers. And I thank God that President Bush has stated, we need a Constitutional amendment that states that marriage is between a man and a woman.::Jimmy Swaggart
Evolution is a bankrupt speculative philosophy, not a scientific fact. Only a spiritually bankrupt society could ever believe it. Only atheists could accept this Satanic theory.::Jimmy Swaggart
I don't know what the secret to longevity as an actress is. It's more than talent and beauty. Maybe it's the audience seeing itself in you.::Joan Blondell
I don't believe in dieting.::Joan Collins
I've never chased fame. I came into this business to be a theatre actress. I was nine when I first appeared on stage. But I can't say I would turn my back on fortune. I'm someone who enjoys the benefits of money.::Joan Collins
I think health is another exceedingly important thing.::Joan Collins
I have the absolute utmost respect for soap opera actors now. They work harder than any actor I know in any other medium. And they don't get very much approbation for it.::Joan Collins
I think it has something to do with being British. We don't take ourselves as seriously as some other countries do. I think a lot of people take themselves far too seriously I find that a very tedious attitude.::Joan Collins
Of course it's true: the public want to see young people - young people are the people who go to the cinema. It's a sad fact of life, but you've got to accept it and not whine about it.::Joan Collins
Age is just a number. It's totally irrelevant unless, of course, you happen to be a bottle of wine.::Joan Collins
The problem with beauty is that it's like being born rich and getting poorer.::Joan Collins
I don't know why people are so obsessed with age anyway. I mean, 90 is the new 70 70 is the new 50 and 50 is the new 40 so the whole act-your-age thing? Only up to a point.::Joan Collins
The body is like a car: the older you become the more care you have to take care of it - and you don't leave a Ferrari out in the sun.::Joan Collins
I don't look my age, I don't feel my age and I don't act my age. To me age is just a number.::Joan Collins
And I think of that again as I've written in several of my beauty books, a lot of health comes from the proper eating habits, which are something that - you know, I come from a generation that wasn't - didn't have a lot of food.::Joan Collins
I've three children, three grandchildren, I work, I travel, and I'm very happily married. I'm very satisfied and happy with my life and there really isn't anything I want.::Joan Collins
Well I've written four beauty books as well.::Joan Collins
I have always known what I wanted, and that was beauty... in every form.::Joan Crawford
Recently I heard a 'wise guy' story that I had a party at my home for twenty-five men. It's an interesting story, but I don't know twenty-five men I'd want to invite ta a party.::Joan Crawford
I write entirely to find out what I'm thinking, what I'm looking at, what I see and what it means. What I want and what I fear.::Joan Didion
Strength is one of those things you're supposed to have. You don't feel that you have it at the time you're going through it.::Joan Didion
Before I'd written movies, I never could do big set-piece scenes with a lot of different speakers - when you've got twelve people around a dinner table talking at cross purposes. I had always been impressed by other people's ability to do that.::Joan Didion
Was it only by dreaming or writing that I could find out what I thought?::Joan Didion
Writing fiction is for me a fraught business, an occasion of daily dread for at least the first half of the novel, and sometimes all the way through. The work process is totally different from writing nonfiction. You have to sit down every day and make it up.::Joan Didion
To free us from the expectations of others, to give us back to ourselves - there lies the great, singular power of self-respect.::Joan Didion
I'm not sure I have the physical strength to undertake a novel.::Joan Didion

Boldness is a mask for fear, however great.::John Dryden

If the experience of science teaches anything, it's that the world is very strange and surprising. The many revolutions in science have certainly shown that.::John Polkinghorne

War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse.::John Stuart Mill
The dictum that truth always triumphs over persecution is one of the pleasant falsehoods which men repeat after one another till they pass into commonplaces, but which all experience refutes.::John Stuart Mill

If all mankind minus one were of one opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind.::John Stuart Mill

To me, horror is when I see somebody lying. I mean a person I know. A friend. And he's telling me something that I accept. And then suddenly, as he or she is telling it, there's something that gives them away. They're not telling me the truth.::Jonathan Frid
Many of those who argue for vouchers say that they simply want to use competition to improve public education. I don't think it works that way, and I've been watching this for a longtime.::Jonathan Kozol
Instead of seeing these children for the blessings that they are, we are measuring them only by the standard of whether they will be future deficits or assets for our nation's competitive needs.::Jonathan Kozol
A great deal has been written in recent years about the purported lack of motivation in the children of the Negro ghettos. Little in my experience supports this, yet the phrase has been repeated endlessly, and the blame in almost all cases is placed somewhere outside the classroom.::Jonathan Kozol
I feel, in the end, as if everything I've done has been a failure.::Jonathan Kozol
During the decades after Brown v. Board of Education there was terrific progress. Tens of thousands of public schools were integrated racially. During that time the gap between black and white achievement narrowed.::Jonathan Kozol
Apartheid education, rarely mentioned in the press or openly confronted even among once-progressive educators, is alive and well and rapidly increasing now in the United States.::Jonathan Kozol
We are now operating a school system in America that's more segregated than at any time since the death of Martin Luther King.::Jonathan Kozol
No Child Left Behind's fourth-grade gains aren't learning gains, they're testing gains. That's why they don't last. The law is a distraction from things that really count.::Jonathan Kozol
But for the children of the poorest people we're stripping the curriculum, removing the arts and music, and drilling the children into useful labor. We're not valuing a child for the time in which she actually is a child.::Jonathan Kozol
The contrasts between what is spent today to educate a child in the poorest New York City neighborhoods, where teacher salaries are often even lower than the city averages, and spending levels in the wealthiest suburban areas are daunting challenges to any hope New Yorkers might retain that even semblances of fairness still prevail.::Jonathan Kozol
When I was teaching in the 1960s in Boston, there was a great deal of hope in the air. Martin Luther King Jr. was alive, Malcolm X was alive great, great leaders were emerging from the southern freedom movement.::Jonathan Kozol
I am opposed to the use of public funds for private education.::Jonathan Kozol
If you grow up in the South Bronx today or in south-central Los Angeles or Pittsburgh or Philadelphia, you quickly come to understand that you have been set apart and that there's no will in this society to bring you back into the mainstream.::Jonathan Kozol
By far the most important factor in the success or failure of any school, far more important than tests or standards or business-model methods of accountability, is simply attracting the best-educated, most exciting young people into urban schools and keeping them there.::Jonathan Kozol
The inequalities are greater now than in '92. Some states have equalized per-pupil spending but they set the 'equal level' very low, so that wealthy districts simply raise extra money privately.::Jonathan Kozol
At that time, I had recently finished a book called Amazing Grace, which many people tell me is a very painful book to read. Well, if it was painful to read, it was also painful to write. I had pains in my chest for two years while I was writing that book.::Jonathan Kozol

Racial segregation has come back to public education with a vengeance.::Jonathan Kozol
But let us remember, at the same time, government is sacred, and not to be trifled with.::Jonathan Mayhew
I now add, farther, that the apostle's argument is so far from proving it to be the duty of people to obey, and submit to, such rulers as act in contradiction to the public good, and so to the design of their office, that it proves the direct contrary.::Jonathan Mayhew
It is our happiness to live under the government of a PRINCE who is satisfied with ruling according to law as every other good prince will - We enjoy under his administration all the liberty that is proper and expedient for us.::Jonathan Mayhew

The institution of a public library, containing books on education, would be well adapted for the information of teachers, many of whom are not able to purchase expensive publications on those subjects.::Joseph Lancaster
Many thousands of youth have been deprived of the benefit of education thereby, their morals ruined, and talents irretrievably lost to society, for want of cultivation: while two parties have been idly contending who should bestow it.::Joseph Lancaster
All are agreed, that the increase of learning and good morals are great blessings to society.::Joseph Lancaster
I am persuaded, that if any attempt is made to improve the education of the poor, and such an unmanly spirit should guide the resolution of a society or committee for that purpose, it would render the design abortive.::Joseph Lancaster
The complaint of bad pay, and difficulty in obtaining it, is almost generally reiterated through every department of education.::Joseph Lancaster
May this plain statement of facts prevail on the friends of the rising generation to interpose for their welfare that the education of children may no longer be to parent and master a lottery, in which the prizes bear no proportion to the enormous number of blanks.::Joseph Lancaster
THE rich possess ample means to realize any theory they may chuse to adopt in the education of their children, regardless of the cost but it is not so with him whose Subsistence is derived from industry.::Joseph Lancaster
A system of education, which would not gratify this disposition in any party, is requisite, in order to obviate the difficulty, and the reader will find a something said to that purpose in perusing this tract.::Joseph Lancaster
When obedience to the Divine precepts keeps pace with knowledge, in the mind of any man, that man is a Christian and when the fruits of Christianity are produced, that man is a disciple of our blessed Lord, let his profession of religion be what it may.::Joseph Lancaster
More than any other in Western Europe, Britain remains a country where a traveler has to think twice before indulging in the ordinary food of ordinary people.::Joseph Lelyveld

The more elaborate our means of communication, the less we communicate.::Joseph Priestley
An able, disinterested, public-spirited press, with trained intelligence to know the right and courage to do it, can preserve that public virtue without which popular government is a sham and a mockery.::Joseph Pulitzer
But the first the general public learned about the discovery was the news of the destruction of Hiroshima by the atom bomb. A splendid achievement of science and technology had turned malign. Science became identified with death and destruction.::Joseph Rotblat
From my earliest days I had a passion for science.::Joseph Rotblat
Indeed, the whole human species is endangered, by nuclear weapons or by other means of wholesale destruction which further advances in science are likely to produce.::Joseph Rotblat
At a time when science plays such a powerful role in the life of society, when the destiny of the whole of mankind may hinge on the results of scientific research, it is incumbent on all scientists to be fully conscious of that role, and conduct themselves accordingly.::Joseph Rotblat
I saw science as being in harmony with humanity.::Joseph Rotblat
I did not imagine that the second half of my life would be spent on efforts to avert a mortal danger to humanity created by science.::Joseph Rotblat
Several studies, and a number of public statements by senior military and political personalities, testify that - except for disputes between the present nuclear states - all military conflicts, as well as threats to peace, can be dealt with using conventional weapons.::Joseph Rotblat
Let me remind you that nuclear disarmament is not just an ardent desire of the people, as expressed in many resolutions of the United Nations. It is a legal commitment by the five official nuclear states, entered into when they signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty.::Joseph Rotblat
My third appeal is to my fellow citizens in all countries: Help us to establish lasting peace in the world.::Joseph Rotblat
Death is the solution to all problems. No man - no problem.::Joseph Stalin
In the Soviet army it takes more courage to retreat than advance.::Joseph Stalin
Education is a weapon whose effects depend on who holds it in his hands and at whom it is aimed.::Joseph Stalin
One death is a tragedy one million is a statistic.::Joseph Stalin
History shows that there are no invincible armies.::Joseph Stalin
I trust no one, not even myself.::Joseph Stalin
Death solves all problems - no man, no problem.::Joseph Stalin
The death of one man is a tragedy. The death of millions is a statistic.::Joseph Stalin
If any foreign minister begins to defend to the death a 'peace conference,' you can be sure his government has already placed its orders for new battleships and airplanes.::Joseph Stalin
I believe in one thing only, the power of human will.::Joseph Stalin
The only real power comes out of a long rifle.::Joseph Stalin
If the opposition disarms, well and good. If it refuses to disarm, we shall disarm it ourselves.::Joseph Stalin
It is enough that the people know there was an election. The people who cast the votes decide nothing. The people who count the votes decide everything.::Joseph Stalin
A good government implies two things first, fidelity to the objects of the government secondly, a knowledge of the means, by which those objects can be best attained.::Joseph Story
And it is no less true, that personal security and private property rest entirely upon the wisdom, the stability, and the integrity of the courts of justice.::Joseph Story
Republics are created by the virtue, public spirit, and intelligence of the citizens. They fall, when the wise are banished from the public councils, because they dare to be honest, and the profligate are rewarded, because they flatter the people, in order to betray them.::Joseph Story
Cats are rather delicate creatures and they are subject to a good many different ailments, but I have never heard of one who suffered from insomnia.::Joseph Wood Krutch
Happiness is itself a kind of gratitude.::Joseph Wood Krutch
Cats seem to go on the principle that it never does any harm to ask for what you want.::Joseph Wood Krutch
If we do not permit the earth to produce beauty and joy, it will in the end not produce food, either.::Joseph Wood Krutch
Though many have tried, no one has ever yet explained away the decisive fact that science, which can do so much, cannot decide what it ought to do.::Joseph Wood Krutch
The snow itself is lonely or, if you prefer, self-sufficient. There is no other time when the whole world seems composed of one thing and one thing only.::Joseph Wood Krutch
It is not ignorance but knowledge which is the mother of wonder.::Joseph Wood Krutch
When a man wantonly destroys one of the works of man we call him a vandal. When he destroys one of the works of god we call him a sportsman.::Joseph Wood Krutch
If people destroy something replaceable made by mankind, they are called vandals; if they destroy something irreplaceable made by God, they are called developers.::Joseph Wood Krutch
What a man knows is everywhere at war with what he wants.::Joseph Wood Krutch
Security depends not so much upon how much you have, as upon how much you can do without.::Joseph Wood Krutch
Every country has the government it deserves.::Joseph de Maistre

There is no greater evidence of superior intelligence than to be surprised at nothing.::Josh Billings
A good way I know to find happiness, is to not bore a hole to fit the plug.::Josh Billings

Time is like money, the less we have of it to spare the further we make it go.::Josh Billings
As scarce as truth is, the supply has always been in excess of the demand.::Josh Billings

After I set out to refute Christianity intellectually and couldn't, I came to the conclusion the Bible was true and Jesus Christ was God's Son.::Josh McDowell
The first thing that stuck in the minds of the disciples was not the empty tomb, but rather the empty grave clothes - undisturbed in form and position.::Josh McDowell
On that Sunday morning the first thing that impressed the people who approached the tomb was the unusual position of the one and a half to two ton stone that had been lodged in front of the doorway.::Josh McDowell
Anyone with sincere religious beliefs cannot say that all religions are true. That is so illogical it is pathetic. All religion cannot be true because some of them are so diametrically opposed to each other.::Josh McDowell
Jesus claimed He had the power to raise himself from the dead and His followers would be raised from the dead. That's a unique claim in the literature of religion.::Josh McDowell
I would say 90 percent of Christians do not have a worldview, in other words a view of the world, based on the Scripture and a relationship with God.::Josh McDowell
Where I once constantly lost my temper, I found myself arriving at a crisis and experiencing peace.::Josh McDowell
Every kid needs to say, 'I want what my mom and dad have.'::Josh McDowell
Prayer is talking with God. God knows your heart and is not so concerned with your words as He is with the attitude of your heart.::Josh McDowell
While the resurrection promises us a new and perfect life in the future, God loves us too much to leave us alone to contend with the pain, guilt and loneliness of our present life.::Josh McDowell
If Jesus Christ was who He claimed to be, and He did die on a cross at a point of time in history, then, for all history past and all history future it is relevant because that is the very focal point for forgiveness and redemption.::Josh McDowell
As a reward for their efforts, however, those early Christians were beaten, stoned to death, thrown to the lions, tortured and crucified. Every conceivable method was used to stop them from talking.::Josh McDowell
Christ appeared alive on several occasions after the cataclysmic events of that first Easter.::Josh McDowell
I've never had anyone define purity. You probably can't define purity. Purity is to live according to original design.::Josh McDowell
But we can hold our spirits and our bodies so pure and high, we may cherish such thoughts and such ideals, and dream such dreams of lofty purpose, that we can determine and know what manner of men we will be, whenever and wherever the hour strikes and calls to noble action.::Joshua Chamberlain
This is the great reward of service, to live, far out and on, in the life of others this is the mystery of Christ, - to give life's best for such high sake that it shall be found again unto life eternal.::Joshua Chamberlain
But the cause for which we fought was higher our thought wider... That thought was our power.::Joshua Chamberlain
We know not of the future and cannot plan for it much.::Joshua Chamberlain
I'm chairing a UNESCO committee on how to improve global Internet communications for science help third-world people get onto the Net so they can be part of the process.::Joshua Lederberg
I hope I've lived a life of science whose style will encourage younger people.::Joshua Lederberg
I did get a very fine education, and not just in science. It took some pressure on the part of my elders to convince me that I really should take an interest in humanities.::Joshua Lederberg
Being successful at a very young age gave me the confidence and the capability to try out other things.::Joshua Lederberg
I started on the use of the Internet for scientific communication. Our research group was one of the very first to make really systematic use of it as a way of managing research projects.::Joshua Lederberg
I'd like to put in a vote for the intrinsic fascination of science.::Joshua Lederberg
I get curious about new things. My real strength is going into a field that has not been investigated before, and finding new approaches to it.::Joshua Lederberg
I certainly saw science as a kind of calling, and one with as much legitimacy as a religious calling.::Joshua Lederberg
Music has a poetry of its own, and that poetry is called melody.::Joshua Logan
Anyhow, a philosophical turn of thought now was not amiss, else one's patience would have given out almost at the harbour entrance. The term of her probation was eight days.::Joshua Slocum
Listen to any musical phrase or rhythm, and grasp it as a whole, and you thereupon have present in you the image, so to speak, of the divine knowledge of the temporal order.::Josiah Royce
Our will makes constantly a sort of agreement with the world, whereby, if the world will continually show some respect to the will, the will shall consent to be strenuous in its industry.::Josiah Royce
Information can bring you choices and choices bring power - educate yourself about your options and choices. Never remain in the dark of ignorance.::Joy Page
Dream and give yourself permission to envision a You that you choose to be.::Joy Page
Instead of focusing on that circumstances that you cannot change - focus strongly and powerfully on the circumstances that you can.::Joy Page
People desire to separate their worlds into polarities of dark and light, ugly and beautiful, good and evil, right and wrong, inside and outside. Polarities serve us in our learning and growth, but as souls we are all.::Joy Page
The best proof of love is trust.::Joyce Brothers
Marriage is not just spiritual communion, it is also remembering to take out the trash.::Joyce Brothers
Accept that all of us can be hurt, that all of us can and surely will at times fail. Other vulnerabilities, like being embarrassed or risking love, can be terrifying, too. I think we should follow a simple rule: if we can take the worst, take the risk.::Joyce Brothers
A strong, positive self-image is the best possible preparation for success.::Joyce Brothers
Trust your hunches. They're usually based on facts filed away just below the conscious level.::Joyce Brothers
Love comes when manipulation stops when you think more about the other person than about his or her reactions to you. When you dare to reveal yourself fully. When you dare to be vulnerable.::Joyce Brothers
Being taken for granted can be a compliment. It means that you've become a comfortable, trusted element in another person's life.::Joyce Brothers
The person interested in success has to learn to view failure as a healthy, inevitable part of the process of getting to the top.::Joyce Brothers
Virginity is such a personal thing. You can't judge anyone on it. A lot of young women feel they want to save themselves for the man who they think they'll love forever.::Joyce Brothers
In love there are two things - bodies and words.::Joyce Carol Oates
As a teacher at Princeton, I'm surrounded by people who work hard so I just make good use of my time. And I don't really think of it as work - writing a novel, in one sense, is a problem-solving exercise.::Joyce Carol Oates
It seems disingenuous to ask a writer why she, or he, is writing about a violent subject when the world and history are filled with violence.::Joyce Carol Oates
If food is poetry, is not poetry also food?::Joyce Carol Oates
To be Jewish is to be specifically identified with a history. And if you're not aware of that when you're a child, the whole tradition is lost.::Joyce Carol Oates
Boxing is a celebration of the lost religion of masculinity all the more trenchant for its being lost.::Joyce Carol Oates
I could never take the idea of religion very seriously.::Joyce Carol Oates
Probably nothing serious or worthwhile can be accomplished without one's willingness to be alone for sustained periods of time, which is not to say that one must live alone, obsessively.::Joyce Carol Oates
Yes, I've listened to just a few audiobooks - but hope to listen to more. I've wanted to investigate how my own books sound in this format and find the experience of listening, and not reading, quite fascinating.::Joyce Carol Oates
Boxing has become America's tragic theater.::Joyce Carol Oates
If you are a writer you locate yourself behind a wall of silence and no matter what you are doing, driving a car or walking or doing housework you can still be writing, because you have that space.::Joyce Carol Oates
Anyone who teaches knows that you don't really experience a text until you've taught it, in loving detail, with an intelligent and responsive class.::Joyce Carol Oates
Obviously the imagination is fueled by emotions beyond the control of the conscious mind.::Joyce Carol Oates
Love doesn't grow on trees like apples in Eden - it's something you have to make. And you must use your imagination too.::Joyce Cary
The will is never free - it is always attached to an object, a purpose. It is simply the engine in the car - it can't steer.::Joyce Cary
I look upon life as a gift from God. I did nothing to earn it. Now that the time is coming to give it back, I have no right to complain.::Joyce Cary
Religion is organized to satisfy and guide the soul - politics does the same thing for the body.::Joyce Cary
There is no such thing as the pursuit of happiness, but there is the discovery of joy.::Joyce Grenfell
Happiness is the sublime moment when you get out of your corsets at night.::Joyce Grenfell
I think that I shall never see a poem lovely as a tree.::Joyce Kilmer
Throughout its history, the international Olympic Committee has struggled to spread its ideal of fraternity, friendship, peace and universal understanding.::Juan Antonio Samaranch
We peruse one ideal, that of bringing people together in peace, irrespective of race, religion and political convictions, for the benefit of mankind.::Juan Antonio Samaranch
Olympism is the marriage of sport and culture.::Juan Antonio Samaranch
Our philosophy precedes from the belief that sport is an inalienable part of the educational process and a factor for promoting peace, friendship, cooperation and understanding among peoples.::Juan Antonio Samaranch
In the Europe which was created by the Second World War, divided into two blocks, each in need of a revolution that would end the abuses and injustices of capitalism and the privileges of a bureaucratic caste, collective faith does not exist.::Juan Goytisolo
In times when religious or political faith or hope predominates, the writer functions totally in unison with society, and expresses society's feelings, beliefs, and hopes in perfect harmony.::Juan Goytisolo
In my opinion, the most significant works of the twentieth century are those that rise beyond the conceptual tyranny of genre they are, at the same time, poetry, criticism, narrative, drama, etc.::Juan Goytisolo
And it is because a series of elements in Spanish life which operate today the same way as they did in the times of Blanco White made obvious my relationship with him, based on a similarity in Spain's condition.::Juan Goytisolo
Marks of Identity is, among other things, the expression of the process of alienation in a contemporary intellectual with respect to his own country.::Juan Goytisolo
When I write now I do not invent situation, characters, or actions, but rather structures and discursive forms, textual groupings which are combined according to secret affinities among themselves, as in architecture or the plastic arts.::Juan Goytisolo
I always pet a dog with my left hand because if he bit me I'd still have my right hand to paint with.::Juan Gris
The driver of a racing car is a component. When I first began, I used to grip the steering wheel firmly, and I changed gear so hard that I damaged my hand.::Juan Manuel Fangio
We are all so close. We are godfather to each others' kids. I was the best man at Jesus' wedding.::Juan Marichal
Love makes a subtle man out of a crude one, it gives eloquence to the mute, it gives courage the cowardly and makes the idle quick and sharp.::Juan Ruiz
Sometimes nudity is gratuitous. We just live in a society where everything goes.::Judi Dench
People who keep stiff upper lips find that it's damn hard to smile.::Judith Guest
On the one hand, shopping is dependable: You can do it alone, if you lose your heart to something that is wrong for you, you can return it it's instant gratification and yet something you buy may well last for years.::Judith Krantz
Heaven knows, I've exposed myself in my novels through the use of fantasy and imagination... now my new book is about what really happened to me... not my heroines.::Judith Krantz
I got that experience through dating dozens of men for six years after college, getting an entry level magazine job at 21, working in the fiction department at Good Housekeeping and then working as a fashion editor there as well as writing many articles for the magazine.::Judith Krantz
Many people mistakenly think a new technology cancels out an old one.::Judith Martin
Parents should conduct their arguments in quiet, respectful tones, but in a foreign language. You'd be surprised what an inducement that is to the education of children.::Judith Martin
I write poetry in order to live more fully.::Judith Rodriguez
It's astonishing what some women will put up with just to have a warm body. Some of the brightest women I know are just obsessed with that search. It's very sad.::Judith Rossner
It takes far less courage to kill yourself than it takes to make yourself wake up one more time. It's harder to stay where you are than to get out. For everyone but you, that is.::Judith Rossner
We will have to give up the hope that, if we try hard, we somehow will always do right by our children. The connection is imperfect. We will sometimes do wrong.::Judith Viorst
Close friends contribute to our personal growth. They also contribute to our personal pleasure, making the music sound sweeter, the wine taste richer, the laughter ring louder because they are there.::Judith Viorst
You end up as you deserve. In old age you must put up with the face, the friends, the health, and the children you have earned.::Judith Viorst
When he is late for dinner and I know he must be either having an affair or lying dead in the street, I always hope he's dead.::Judith Viorst
Love is much nicer to be in than an automobile accident, a tight girdle, a higher tax bracket or a holding pattern over Philadelphia.::Judith Viorst
One advantage of marriage is that, when you fall out of love with him or he falls out of love with you, it keeps you together until you fall in again.::Judith Viorst
Strength is the capacity to break a chocolate bar into four pieces with your bare hands - and then eat just one of the pieces.::Judith Viorst
Only after I faced the unhappiness of my first marriage did I start on the path of personal growth.::Judith Wright
No Congress ever has seen fit to amend the Constitution to address any issue related to marriage. No Constitutional Amendment was needed to ban polygamy or bigamy, nor was a Constitutional Amendment needed to set a uniform age of majority to ban child marriages.::Judy Biggert
Since coming to Congress, I have been advocating for increased resources for research in the physical sciences and for the Department of Energy Office of Science in particular.::Judy Biggert
As the Nation's primary supporter of research in the physical sciences, the DOE Office of Science led the way in creating a unique system of large-scale, specialized, often one-of-a-kind facilities for scientific discovery.::Judy Biggert
No one ever said that fighting the war against terrorism and defending our homeland would be easy. So let's support our troops, law enforcement workers, and our mission to keep our nation and our children safe in the days and years to come.::Judy Biggert
Let me first state that I believe that marriage is a sacred union between one man and one woman.::Judy Biggert
Research has shown time and time again that infants who receive the high-quality child care and early education programs do better in school, have more developed social skills, and display fewer behavior problems.::Judy Biggert
Our health care system is the finest in the world, but we still have too many uninsured Americans, too high prices for prescription drugs, and too many frivolous lawsuits driving our physicians out of state or out of business.::Judy Biggert
Second, marriage is an issue that our Founding Fathers wisely left to the states.::Judy Biggert
As children, many of us were taught never to talk to strangers. As parents and grandparents, our message must change with technology to include strangers on the Internet.::Judy Biggert
I loved to read, and I think any child who loves to read will read anything, including the back of the cereal box, which I did every morning.::Judy Blume
Ideas seem to come from everywhere - my life, everything I see, hear, and read, and most of all, from my imagination. I have a lot of imagination.::Judy Blume
Let children read whatever they want and then talk about it with them. If parents and kids can talk together, we won't have as much censorship because we won't have as much fear.::Judy Blume
What I remember when I started to write was how I couldn't wait to get up in the morning to get to my characters.::Judy Blume
I am a big defender of 'Harry Potter,' and I think any book that gets kids to read are books that we should cherish, we should be thankful for them.::Judy Blume
The books that will never be read. And all due to the fear of censorship. As always, young readers will be the real losers.::Judy Blume
I am trying to make art that relates to the deepest and most mythic concerns of human kind and I believe that, at this moment of history, feminism is humanism.::Judy Chicago
I have inspiration and feelings of being alive most every day I live.::Judy Collins
For many centuries, suicides were treated like criminals by the society. That is part of the terrible legacy that has come down into society's method of handling suicide recovery. Now we have to fight off the demons that have been hanging around suicide for centuries.::Judy Collins
I was raised to speak out about politics and the world around me. I would do it whether I was in the public or not. It is the way I was taught. The American way.::Judy Collins
I think people who are creative are the luckiest people on earth. I know that there are no shortcuts, but you must keep your faith in something Greater than You, and keep doing what you love. Do what you love, and you will find the way to get it out to the world.::Judy Collins
I feel so very grateful to have the voice God gave me. It takes a lot of rest and training to sing, and I was lucky that I found a great teacher when I first moved to New York.::Judy Collins
I don't dream songs. I'm more apt to write dreams down and then to be able to interpret them into a song. I also tend to get up and write prose in the morning from which will come songs.::Judy Collins
I don't think you get to good writing unless you expose yourself and your feelings. Deep songs don't come from the surface they come from the deep down. The poetry and the songs that you are suppose to write, I believe are in your heart.::Judy Collins
I had some wonderful dreaming meetings. I can't tell you specifically what they've been in the recent months. In the past they've been verbal kinds of messages that he needed to give me. Now they're more dreams of his presence.::Judy Collins
My book 'Trust Your Heart', which is the story of my life, will be followed by 'Singing Lessons', a memoir of love, loss, hope, and healing, which talks about the death of my son and the hope that has been the aftermath of the healing from that tragedy.::Judy Collins
We cast away priceless time in dreams, born of imagination, fed upon illusion, and put to death by reality.::Judy Garland
I was born at the age of twelve on an MGM lot.::Judy Garland
In the silence of night I have often wished for just a few words of love from one man, rather than the applause of thousands of people.::Judy Garland
You are never so alone as when you are ill on stage. The most nightmarish feeling in the world is suddenly to feel like throwing up in front of four thousand people.::Judy Garland
If I am a legend, then why am I so lonely?::Judy Garland
I've always taken 'The Wizard of Oz' very seriously, you know. I believe in the idea of the rainbow. And I've spent my entire life trying to get over it.::Judy Garland
I can live without money, but I cannot live without love.::Judy Garland
I've seen the ticket, and I still can't believe it. When I see the money, I hope I don't hit the floor.::Judy Garland
For it was not into my ear you whispered, but into my heart. It was not my lips you kissed, but my soul.::Judy Garland
I am not a member of any organization listed by the Attorney General as subversive. In any instance where I lent my name in the past, it was certainly without knowledge that such an organization was subversive. I have always been essentially and foremost an American.::Judy Holliday
I thought I was learning about show business. The more painful it was, the more important I thought the experience must be. Hating it, I convinced myself it must be invaluable.::Judy Holliday
Lovers have a right to betray you... friends don't.::Judy Holliday
I get very nervous whenever I think about it. I've never done a serious play, and I have such awe of the woman - she's really my only idol. It's going to be a big stretch - certain people come out on stage and your face muscles automatically tense and you get ready to smile.::Judy Holliday
My Daddy liked physical fitness and wanted me to be a prizefighter.::Judy Johnson
Getting out of bed in the morning is an act of false confidence.::Jules Feiffer
Maturity is only a short break in adolescence.::Jules Feiffer
The danger of success is that it makes us forget the world's dreadful injustice.::Jules Renard
Failure is not our only punishment for laziness there is also the success of others.::Jules Renard
Truth makes many appeals, not the least of which is its power to shock.::Jules Renard
Writing is the only profession where no one considers you ridiculous if you earn no money.::Jules Renard
I finally know what distinguishes man from the other beasts: financial worries.::Jules Renard
There are places and moments in which one is so completely alone that one sees the world entire.::Jules Renard
We were alone. Where, I could not say, hardly imagine. All was black, and such a dense black that, after some minutes, my eyes had not been able to discern even the faintest glimmer.::Jules Verne
Science, my lad, is made up of mistakes, but they are mistakes which it is useful to make, because they lead little by little to the truth.::Jules Verne
The sea is everything. It covers seven tenths of the terrestrial globe. Its breath is pure and healthy. It is an immense desert, where man is never lonely, for he feels life stirring on all sides.::Jules Verne
I believe cats to be spirits come to earth. A cat, I am sure, could walk on a cloud without coming through.::Jules Verne
We may brave human laws, but we cannot resist natural ones.::Jules Verne
The Nautilus was piercing the water with its sharp spur, after having accomplished nearly ten thousand leagues in three months and a half, a distance greater than the great circle of the earth. Where were we going now, and what was reserved for the future?::Jules Verne
I was going to be a great woman novelist. Then the war came along and I think it's hard for young people today, don't you, to realize that when World War II happened we were dying to go and help our country.::Julia Child
Life itself is the proper binge.::Julia Child
When I got to France I realized I didn't know very much about food at all. I'd never had a real cake. I'd had those cakes from cake mixes or the ones that have a lot of baking powder in them. A really good French cake doesn't have anything like that in it - it's all egg power.::Julia Child
Being tall is an advantage, especially in business. People will always remember you. And if you're in a crowd, you'll always have some clean air to breathe.::Julia Child
I hate organized religion. I think you have to love thy neighbor as thyself. I think you have to pick your own God and be true to him. I always say 'him' rather than 'her.' Maybe it's because of my generation, but I don't like the idea of a female God. I see God as a benevolent male.::Julia Child
I think careful cooking is love, don't you? The loveliest thing you can cook for someone who's close to you is about as nice a valentine as you can give.::Julia Child
I think one of the terrible things today is that people have this deathly fear of food: fear of eggs, say, or fear of butter. Most doctors feel that you can have a little bit of everything.::Julia Child
In France, cooking is a serious art form and a national sport.::Julia Child
In the 1970s we got nouvelle cuisine, in which a lot of the old rules were kicked over. And then we had cuisine minceur, which people mixed up with nouvelle cuisine but was actually fancy diet cooking.::Julia Child
As we say in the American Institute of Wine and Food, small helpings, no seconds. A little bit of everything. No snacking. And have a good time.::Julia Child
The secret of a happy marriage is finding the right person. You know they're right if you love to be with them all the time.::Julia Child
Animals that we eat are raised for food in the most economical way possible, and the serious food producers do it in the most humane way possible. I think anyone who is a carnivore needs to understand that meat does not originally come in these neat little packages.::Julia Child
When we are angry or depressed in our creativity, we have misplaced our power. We have allowed someone else to determine our worth, and then we are angry at being undervalued.::Julia Margaret Cameron
I longed to arrest all beauty that came before me, and at length the longing has been satisfied.::Julia Margaret Cameron
Architecture is a visual art, and the buildings speak for themselves.::Julia Morgan
My buildings will be my legacy... they will speak for me long after I'm gone.::Julia Morgan
I know not why there is such a melancholy feeling attached to the remembrance of past happiness, except that we fear that the future can have nothing so bright as the past.::Julia Ward Howe
Marriage, like death, is a debt we owe to nature.::Julia Ward Howe
While your life is the true expression of your faith, whom can you fear?::Julia Ward Howe
Theology in general seems to me a substitution of human ingenuity for divine wisdom.::Julia Ward Howe
Operationally, God is beginning to resemble not a ruler but the last fading smile of a cosmic Cheshire cat.::Julian Huxley
All love shifts and changes. I don't know if you can be wholeheartedly in love all the time.::Julie Andrews
On the whole, I think women wear too much and are to fussy. You can't see the person for all the clutter.::Julie Andrews
Because of the Thames I have always loved inland waterways - water in general, water sounds - there's music in water. Brooks babbling, fountains splashing. Weirs, waterfalls tumbling, gushing.::Julie Andrews
I think that the best way to explain that is that my mother gave me all the color and character and flare and liveliness, and my father gave me all the sanity and nature and all the things that helped me be a more rounded human being.::Julie Andrews
I am a liberated woman. And I do believe if a woman does equal work she should be paid equal money. But personally I am feminine and I do like male authority to lean on.::Julie Andrews
Sometimes I'm so sweet even I can't stand it.::Julie Andrews
I play with my grandchildren. I tend to my garden, which I love. Of course, I love to read, and family is really what it's all about.::Julie Andrews
My sense of the family history is somewhat sketchy, because my mother kept a great deal to herself.::Julie Andrews
Behaving like a princess is work. It's not just about looking beautiful or wearing a crown. It's more about how you are inside.::Julie Andrews
I was lucky enough to be the lady that was asked to be Maria in the Sound Of Music, and that film was fortunate enough to be huge hit. The same with Mary Poppins. I got terribly lucky in that respect.::Julie Andrews
Perseverance is failing 19 times and succeeding the 20th.::Julie Andrews
As a rule, my focus is on classical music, but I love jazz. I love everything, actually.::Julie Andrews
I am told that the first comprehensible word I uttered as a child was 'home.'::Julie Andrews
I'm sure any vocal teacher that listens to me would rather cut my throat than do anything - I do everything all wrong - but I think for me that's the best - because I don't think I have a voice so I think what I project would be style - if I learned to sing I'd lose my style.::Julie London
I think that's one of the most difficult things in any marriage - in order to build anything, you must be together. You can't build anything over the telephone.::Julie London
Peace, if it ever exists, will not be based on the fear of war but on the love of peace.::Julien Benda
I shall go further and say that even if an examination of the past could lead to any valid prediction concerning man's future, that prediction would be the contrary of reassuring.::Julien Benda
And History will smile to think that this is the species for which Socrates and Jesus Christ died.::Julien Benda
A child's fear is a world whose dark corners are quite unknown to grownup people it has its sky and its abysses, a sky without stars, abysses into which no light can ever penetrate.::Julien Green
To put yourself in another's place requires real imagination, but by doing so each Girl Scout will be able to love among others happily.::Juliette Gordon Low
My purpose... to go on with my heart and soul, devoting all my energies to Girl Scouts, and heart and hand with them, we will make our lives and the lives of the future girls happy, healthy and holy.::Juliette Gordon Low
Scouting rises within you and inspires you to put forth your best.::Juliette Gordon Low
Badges mean nothing in themselves, but they mark a certain achievement and they are a link between the rich and the poor. For when one girl sees a badge on a sister Scout's arm, if that girl has won the same badge, it at once awakens an interest and sympathy between them.::Juliette Gordon Low
As a rule, men worry more about what they can't see than about what they can.::Julius Caesar
In war, events of importance are the result of trivial causes.::Julius Caesar
Men in general are quick to believe that which they wish to be true.::Julius Caesar
It is easier to find men who will volunteer to die, than to find those who are willing to endure pain with patience.::Julius Caesar
I came, I saw, I conquered.::Julius Caesar
Which death is preferably to every other? 'The unexpected'.::Julius Caesar
It is not these well-fed long-haired men that I fear, but the pale and the hungry-looking.::Julius Caesar
I have lived long enough to satisfy both nature and glory.::Julius Caesar
I love the name of honor, more than I fear death.::Julius Caesar
Experience is the teacher of all things.::Julius Caesar
It is better to create than to learn! Creating is the essence of life.::Julius Caesar
If you must break the law, do it to seize power: in all other cases observe it.::Julius Caesar
Fortune, which has a great deal of power in other matters but especially in war, can bring about great changes in a situation through very slight forces.::Julius Caesar
I'd just as soon stay home and raise babies.::June Allyson
One morning, about four o'clock, I was driving my car just about as fast as I could. I thought, Why am I out this time of night? I was miserable, and it came to me: I'm falling in love with somebody I have no right to fall in love with.::June Carter Cash
I worked with John, but I had enough sense to walk just a little ways behind him. I could have made more records, but I wanted to have a marriage.::June Carter Cash
There are two ways to worry words. One is hoping for the greatest possible beauty in what is created. The other is to tell the truth.::June Jordan
So, poetry becomes a means for useful dialogue between people who are not only unknown, but mute to each other. It produces a dialogue among people that guards all of us against manipulation by our so-called leaders.::June Jordan
In the process of telling the truth about what you feel or what you see, each of us has to get in touch with himself or herself in a really deep, serious way.::June Jordan
The first function of poetry is to tell the truth, to learn how to do that, to find out what you really feel and what you really think.::June Jordan
To tell the truth is to become beautiful, to begin to love yourself, value yourself. And that's political, in its most profound way.::June Jordan
The courts cannot garnish a father's salary, nor freeze his account, nor seize his property on behalf of his children, in our society. Apparently this is because a kid is not a car or a couch or a boat.::June Jordan
I am a feminist, and what that means to me is much the same as the meaning of the fact that I am Black: it means that I must undertake to love myself and to respect myself as though my very life depends upon self-love and self-respect.::June Jordan
That attitude that fighting is probably not fair, but you have to defend yourself anyway and damage the enemy, has been profoundly consequential as far as my political activism goes.::June Jordan
Poetry is a political act because it involves telling the truth.::June Jordan
But, based on my friendship with Evie as young mothers, I started going on freedom rides in 1966.::June Jordan
I wrote those poems for myself, as a way of being a soldier here in this country. I didn't know the poems would travel. I didn't go to Lebanon until two years ago, but people told me that many Arabs had memorized these poems and translated them into Arabic.::June Jordan
Since my induction into the Sports Hall of Fame, I have wanted to have my No. 3 Chevy on exhibit for sports fans to see. I hope others will enjoy the car as much as I have.::Junior Johnson
The Bible is a revelation of the mind and will of God to men. Therein we may learn, what God is.::Jupiter Hammon
But this will not do, God will certainly punish you for stealing and for being unfaithful.::Jupiter Hammon
A child is owed the greatest respect if you have ever have something disgraceful in mind, don't ignore your son's tender years.::Juvenal
Rare is the union of beauty and purity.::Juvenal
Never does nature say one thing and wisdom another.::Juvenal
All wish to possess knowledge, but few, comparatively speaking, are willing to pay the price.::Juvenal
For women's tears are but the sweat of eyes.::Juvenal
I suspect the psychological pressure associated with that crisis caused the first mental blackout I had ever suffered. It contributed to a deterioration in my health that later required the insertion of a heart pacemaker.::Kamisese Mara
The family teaches us about the importance of knowledge, education, hard work and effort. It teaches us about enjoying ourselves, having fun, keeping fit and healthy.::Kamisese Mara
In a multi-racial society, trust, understanding and tolerance are the cornerstones of peace and order.::Kamisese Mara
It is from the traditional family that we absorb those universal ideals and principles which are the teaching of Jesus, the bedrock of our religious faith. We are taught the difference between right and wrong, and about the law, just punishment and discipline.::Kamisese Mara
It is with obedience to your call that I take up the burden of government leadership for the final time.::Kamisese Mara
Whom am I going to trust if I have to back again.::Kamisese Mara
Illiteracy is rampant. People are out of communication.::Karen Black
Like all sciences and all valuations, the psychology of women has hitherto been considered only from the point of view of men.::Karen Horney
Life itself still remains a very effective therapist.::Karen Horney
Fortunately analysis is not the only way to resolve inner conflicts. Life itself still remains a very effective therapist.::Karen Horney
Religion is the possibility of the removal of every ground of confidence except confidence in God alone.::Karl Barth
Laughter is the closest thing to the grace of God.::Karl Barth
Faith is never identical with piety.::Karl Barth
Faith in God's revelation has nothing to do with an ideology which glorifies the status quo.::Karl Barth
It is always the case that when the Christian looks back, he is looking at the forgiveness of sins.::Karl Barth
Man can certainly flee from God... but he cannot escape him. He can certainly hate God and be hateful to God, but he cannot change into its opposite the eternal love of God which triumphs even in his hate.::Karl Barth
Jesus does not give recipes that show the way to God as other teachers of religion do. He is himself the way.::Karl Barth
Even scientific knowledge, if there is anything to it, is not a random observation of random objects for the critical objectivity of significant knowledge is attained as a practice only philosophically in inner action.::Karl Jaspers
If philosophy is practice, a demand to know the manner in which its history is to be studied is entailed: a theoretical attitude toward it becomes real only in the living appropriation of its contents from the texts.::Karl Jaspers
The history of philosophy is not, like the history of the sciences, to be studied with the intellect alone. That which is receptive in us and that which impinges upon us from history is the reality of man's being, unfolding itself in thought.::Karl Jaspers
Only then, approaching my fortieth birthday, I made philosophy my life's work.::Karl Jaspers
I began the study of medicine, impelled by a desire for knowledge of facts and of man. The resolution to do disciplined work tied me to both laboratory and clinic for a long time to come.::Karl Jaspers
Music is part of the life of fashion, too.::Karl Lagerfeld
When I was a child I asked my mother what homosexuality was about and she said - and this was 100 years ago in Germany and she was very open-minded - 'It's like hair color. It's nothing. Some people are blond and some people have dark hair. It's not a subject.' This was a very healthy attitude.::Karl Lagerfeld
I drink Diet Coke from the minute I get up to the minute I go to bed.::Karl Lagerfeld
I think it's horrible that people have to be told. Don't smoke! Everybody knows it's bad for the health. But they have to forbid it.::Karl Lagerfeld
I'm not an employee who goes to the office every morning at the same time. Then, vacations are needed.::Karl Lagerfeld
I never had to learn English, French and German because I was brought up as all three languages. I had a private French teacher before I even went to school. That helped a lot.::Karl Lagerfeld
I had nearly finished school because I was making effort not that bad on that. But there was a law in Germany after the war. You could not make your final examination before 18, so lots of people who were late because of the way had to do it first.::Karl Lagerfeld
Beauty is also submitted to the taste of time, so a beautiful woman from the Belle Epoch is not exactly the perfect beauty of today, so beauty is something that changes with time.::Karl Lagerfeld
No one wants to see curvy women.::Karl Lagerfeld
What I love best in life is new starts.::Karl Lagerfeld
But if I have a lot of imagination, I could tell myself whatever I wanted, you know. I handle myself quite well. I'm kind of fascist with myself, you know. There's no discussion. There is an order. You follow it.::Karl Lagerfeld
You have to like the present if not your life becomes secondhand, if you think it was better before. Or that it will be better in the future.::Karl Lagerfeld
I like today and perhaps a little future still, but the past is really something I'm not interested in. So, as far as I'm concerned, I like only the past of things and people I don't know. When I know, I don't care because I knew how it was.::Karl Lagerfeld
I never smoked. I never drank and I never took drugs. The funny thing is, nothing is more boring, people like this. For me, it's OK. But most of my friends, at least they smoke and drink.::Karl Lagerfeld
I love to watch times change!::Karl Lagerfeld
It's only I have seen enough of it and the funny thing is now, I know that I'm skinny, because I know there are even smaller clothes in the store. I think I'm big, when I was big, I never thought about it.::Karl Lagerfeld
I never - you know also one of the things that would save me for a man my age, it was not that easy to lose that much weight and fall down and look like something draped.::Karl Lagerfeld
The iPod completely changed the way people approach music.::Karl Lagerfeld
There are less than 1 per cent of anorexic girls, but there more than 30 per cent of girls in France - I don't know about England - that are much, much overweight. And it is much more dangerous and very bad for the health.::Karl Lagerfeld
Class struggle: external peace, international solidarity, peace among peoples. This is the sacred slogan of international socialist democracy that liberates nations.::Karl Liebknecht
But Socialism, alone, can bring self-determination of their peoples.::Karl Liebknecht
For capitalism, war and peace are business and nothing but business.::Karl Liebknecht
The failure of the Russian Socialist Republic will be the defeat of the proletariat of the whole world.::Karl Liebknecht
Capitalism is war socialism is peace.::Karl Liebknecht
Revolutions are the locomotives of history.::Karl Marx
The meaning of peace is the absence of opposition to socialism.::Karl Marx
The writer must earn money in order to be able to live and to write, but he must by no means live and write for the purpose of making money.::Karl Marx
The country that is more developed industrially only shows, to the less developed, the image of its own future.::Karl Marx
The human being is in the most literal sense a political animal, not merely a gregarious animal, but an animal which can individuate itself only in the midst of society.::Karl Marx
Greek philosophy seems to have met with something with which a good tragedy is not supposed to meet, namely, a dull ending.::Karl Marx
Society does not consist of individuals but expresses the sum of interrelations, the relations within which these individuals stand.::Karl Marx
Landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed.::Karl Marx
The writer may very well serve a movement of history as its mouthpiece, but he cannot of course create it.::Karl Marx
We should not say that one man's hour is worth another man's hour, but rather that one man during an hour is worth just as much as another man during an hour. Time is everything, man is nothing: he is at the most time's carcass.::Karl Marx
The product of mental labor - science - always stands far below its value, because the labor-time necessary to reproduce it has no relation at all to the labor-time required for its original production.::Karl Marx
In a higher phase of communist society... only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be fully left behind and society inscribe on its banners: from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.::Karl Marx
The first requisite for the happiness of the people is the abolition of religion.::Karl Marx
History does nothing it does not possess immense riches, it does not fight battles. It is men, real, living, who do all this.::Karl Marx
Natural science will in time incorporate into itself the science of man, just as the science of man will incorporate into itself natural science: there will be one science.::Karl Marx
The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e., the class which is the ruling material force of society, is at the same time its ruling intellectual force.::Karl Marx
Capitalist production, therefore, develops technology, and the combining together of various processes into a social whole, only by sapping the original sources of all wealth - the soil and the labourer.::Karl Marx
Capital is reckless of the health or length of life of the laborer, unless under compulsion from society.::Karl Marx
The ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class.::Karl Marx
In bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality, while the living person is dependent and has no individuality.::Karl Marx
The history of all previous societies has been the history of class struggles.::Karl Marx
Capital is money, capital is commodities. By virtue of it being value, it has acquired the occult ability to add value to itself. It brings forth living offspring, or, at the least, lays golden eggs.::Karl Marx
Religion is the opium of the masses.::Karl Marx
Art is always and everywhere the secret confession, and at the same time the immortal movement of its time.::Karl Marx
Anyone who knows anything of history knows that great social changes are impossible without feminine upheaval. Social progress can be measured exactly by the social position of the fair sex, the ugly ones included.::Karl Marx
Necessity is blind until it becomes conscious. Freedom is the consciousness of necessity.::Karl Marx
On a level plain, simple mounds look like hills and the insipid flatness of our present bourgeoisie is to be measured by the altitude of its great intellects.::Karl Marx
Religion is the impotence of the human mind to deal with occurrences it cannot understand.::Karl Marx
It is not history which uses men as a means of achieving - as if it were an individual person - its own ends. History is nothing but the activity of men in pursuit of their ends.::Karl Marx
Men's ideas are the most direct emanations of their material state.::Karl Marx
Experience praises the most happy the one who made the most people happy.::Karl Marx
It is absolutely impossible to transcend the laws of nature. What can change in historically different circumstances is only the form in which these laws expose themselves.::Karl Marx
History repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce.::Karl Marx
Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.::Karl Marx
My host at Richmond, yesterday morning, could not sufficiently express his surprise that I intended to venture to walk as far as Oxford, and still farther. He however was so kind as to send his son, a clever little boy, to show me the road leading to Windsor.::Karl Philipp Moritz
Every view, and every object I studied attentively, by viewing them again and again on every side, for I was anxious to make a lasting impression of it on my imagination.::Karl Philipp Moritz
We must plan for freedom, and not only for security, if for no other reason than that only freedom can make security secure.::Karl Popper
Our knowledge can only be finite, while our ignorance must necessarily be infinite.::Karl Popper
No rational argument will have a rational effect on a man who does not want to adopt a rational attitude.::Karl Popper
Science must begin with myths, and with the criticism of myths.::Karl Popper
Piecemeal social engineering resembles physical engineering in regarding the ends as beyond the province of technology.::Karl Popper
Science may be described as the art of systematic over-simplification.::Karl Popper
Every social organisation which is rooted in life still lasts a long time, even after the conditions from which it drew its strength have changed in a manner unfavourable to it.::Karl Radek
Every year we celebrate the holy season of Advent, O God. Every year we pray those beautiful prayers of longing and waiting, and sing those lovely songs of hope and promise.::Karl Rahner
The Christian of the future will be a mystic or he will not exist at all.::Karl Rahner
How often I have found that we grow to maturity not by doing what we like, but by doing what we should. How true it is that not every 'should' is a compulsion, and not every 'like' is a high morality and true freedom.::Karl Rahner
Poetry is innocent, not wise. It does not learn from experience, because each poetic experience is unique.::Karl Shapiro
But with exquisite breathing you smile, with satisfaction of love, And I touch you again as you tick in the silence and settle in sleep.::Karl Shapiro
And harmony means that the relationship between all the elements used in a composition is balanced, is good.::Karlheinz Stockhausen
And when they encounter works of art which show that using new media can lead to new experiences and to new consciousness, and expand our senses, our perception, our intelligence, our sensibility, then they will become interested in this music.::Karlheinz Stockhausen
Many cats are the death of the mouse.::Kaspar Hauser
She felt like a chess player who, by the clever handling of his pieces, sees the game taking the course intended. Her eyes were bright and tender with a smile as they glanced up into his and her lips looked hungry for the kiss which they invited.::Kate Chopin
I trust it will not be giving away professional secrets to say that many readers would be surprised, perhaps shocked, at the questions which some newspaper editors will put to a defenseless woman under the guise of flattery.::Kate Chopin
I was supposed to be women's lib, and now I'd exceeded it and gone over into international politics.::Kate Millett
A sexual revolution begins with the emancipation of women, who are the chief victims of patriarchy, and also with the ending of homosexual oppression.::Kate Millett
Men and women were declared equal one morning and everybody could divorce each other by postcard.::Kate Millett
Politics is repetition. It is not change. Change is something beyond what we call politics. Change is the essence politics is supposed to be the means to bring into being.::Kate Millett
We are naive and moralistic women. We are human beings who find politics a blight upon the human condition. And do not know how one copes with it except through politics.::Kate Millett
What is our freedom fight about? Is it about the liberation of children or just having sex with them?::Kate Millett
The concept of romantic love affords a means of emotional manipulation which the male is free to exploit, since love is the only circumstance in which the female is (ideologically) pardoned for sexual activity.::Kate Millett
This is how psychiatry has functioned-as a kind of property arm of the government, who can put you away if your husband doesn't like you.::Kate Millett
Aren't women prudes if they don't and prostitutes if they do?::Kate Millett
I shall always respect the composer. If I embellish, it is his idea I am embellishing.::Kate Smith
In 29 years, I had recorded over 2,200 songs. I was amazed.::Kate Smith
As soon as I began to earn what might be called fairly large sums, I bought a car and began to explore the country around New York.::Kate Smith
It became obvious in 1957 that I was endangering my health by carrying so much weight.::Kate Smith
Middle-aged women have greater stability, they are more loyal, and their capacity for steady work is greater than that of younger women.::Kate Smith
I sometimes get that wonderful sympathy between me and the audience, telling me I've reached their hearts. And when I do, the thrill is mine.::Kate Smith
Many people submit to excessive appetites without realizing that they do not need to eat so much food.::Kate Smith
No one can avoid aging, but aging productively is something else.::Katharine Graham
If we had failed to pursue the facts as far as they led, we would have denied the public any knowledge of an unprecedented scheme of political surveillance and sabotage.::Katharine Graham
A mistake is simply another way of doing things.::Katharine Graham
I think most of the people involved in any art always secretly wonder whether they are really there because they're good or there because they're lucky.::Katharine Hepburn
It's life isn't it? You plow ahead and make a hit. And you plow on and someone passes you. Then someone passes them. Time levels.::Katharine Hepburn
Death will be a great relief. No more interviews.::Katharine Hepburn
Love has nothing to do with what you are expecting to get - only with what you are expecting to give - which is everything.::Katharine Hepburn
When I started out, I didn't have any desire to be an actress or to learn how to act. I just wanted to be famous.::Katharine Hepburn
It's a business you go into because your an egocentric. It's a very embarrassing profession.::Katharine Hepburn
Only the really plain people know about love - the very fascinating ones try so hard to create an impression that they soon exhaust their talents.::Katharine Hepburn
Plain women know more about men than beautiful women do.::Katharine Hepburn
We are taught you must blame your father, your sisters, your brothers, the school, the teachers - but never blame yourself. It's never your fault. But it's always your fault, because if you wanted to change you're the one who has got to change.::Katharine Hepburn
Sometimes I wonder if men and women really suit each other. Perhaps they should live next door and just visit now and then.::Katharine Hepburn
Life is to be lived. If you have to support yourself, you had bloody well better find some way that is going to be interesting. And you don't do that by sitting around.::Katharine Hepburn
As for me, prizes are nothing. My prize is my work.::Katharine Hepburn
My greatest strength is common sense. I'm really a standard brand - like Campbell's tomato soup or Baker's chocolate.::Katharine Hepburn
If you want to give up the admiration of thousands of men for the distain of one, go ahead, get married.::Katharine Hepburn
To keep your character intact you cannot stoop to filthy acts. It makes it easier to stoop the next time.::Katharine Hepburn
I never realized until lately that women were supposed to be the inferior sex.::Katharine Hepburn
Marriage is a series of desperate arguments people feel passionately about.::Katharine Hepburn
Life is hard. After all, it kills you.::Katharine Hepburn
Dressing up is a bore. At a certain age, you decorate yourself to attract the opposite sex, and at a certain age, I did that. But I'm past that age.::Katharine Hepburn
Acting is a nice childish profession - pretending you're someone else and, at the same time, selling yourself.::Katharine Hepburn
If you want to sacrifice the admiration of many men for the criticism of one, go ahead, get married.::Katharine Hepburn
From a commercial point of view, if Christmas did not exist it would be necessary to invent it.::Katharine Whitehorn
No nice men are good at getting taxis.::Katharine Whitehorn
The real sin against life is to abuse and destroy beauty, even one's own even more, one's own, for that has been put in our care and we are responsible for its well-being.::Katherine Anne Porter
One of the marks of a gift is to have the courage of it.::Katherine Anne Porter
The older I grow the more I see the influence of my family on my life. I didn't always see it. It was up to our parents to see that we had our education in a town that hadn't yet realized what racial prejudice was but actually knew and practiced it on occasion.::Katherine Dunham
We had maybe the greatest success of any company that I know of in Paris, and after two or three years I wanted to do this same number that we did for PBS, so we did it and Paris had always considered us their darlings.::Katherine Dunham
I have actually five honorary degrees.::Katherine Dunham
Could we change our attitude, we should not only see life differently, but life itself would come to be different.::Katherine Mansfield
It's a terrible thing to be alone - yes it is - it is - but don't lower your mask until you have another mask prepared beneath - as terrible as you like - but a mask.::Katherine Mansfield
Everything in life that we really accept undergoes a change.::Katherine Mansfield
Risk! Risk anything! Care no more for the opinions of others, for those voices. Do the hardest thing on earth for you. Act for yourself. Face the truth.::Katherine Mansfield
I always felt that the great high privilege, relief and comfort of friendship was that one had to explain nothing.::Katherine Mansfield
No gentleman ever discusses any relationship with a lady.::Keith Miller
Pain is the doorway to wisdom and to truth.::Keith Miller
Same-sex marriage would eliminate entirely in law the basic idea of a mother and a father for every child. It would create a society which deliberately chooses to deprive a child of either a mother or a father.::Keith O'Brien
No Government has the moral authority to dismantle the universally understood meaning of marriage.::Keith O'Brien
The church's teaching on marriage is unequivocal, it is uniquely, the union of a man and a woman and it is wrong that governments, politicians or parliaments should seek to alter or destroy that reality.::Keith O'Brien
I know that many of you do wear such a cross of Christ, not in any ostentatious way, not in a way that might harm you at your work or recreation, but a simple indication that you value the role of Jesus Christ in the history of the world, that you are trying to live by Christ's standards in your own daily life.::Keith O'Brien
If marriage can be redefined so that it no longer means a man and a woman but two men or two women, why stop there? Why not allow three men or a woman and two men to constitute a marriage?::Keith O'Brien
Redefining marriage will have huge implications for what is taught in our schools, and for wider society. It will redefine society since the institution of marriage is one of the fundamental building blocks of society. The repercussions of enacting same-sex marriage into law will be immense.::Keith O'Brien
There is no doubt that, as a society, we have become blase about the importance of marriage as a stabilising influence and less inclined to prize it as a worthwhile institution.::Keith O'Brien
Clearly, if it is sensible to hold a referendum on independence, it is crucial that we have one on marriage. It is the only way the country can move forward on this issue. Let all those who have a view on this subject place their trust in the Scottish people and let Scotland decide.::Keith O'Brien
I might be celibate, but I appreciate the wonder of the sacrament of marriage.::Keith O'Brien
In Scotland over many years we have cultivated through our justice system what I hope can be described as a 'culture of compassion.' On the other hand, there still exists in many parts of the U.S., if not nationally, an attitude towards the concept of justice which can only be described as a 'culture of vengeance.'::Keith O'Brien
In the past a leader was a boss. Today's leaders must be partners with their people... they no longer can lead solely based on positional power.::Ken Blanchard
I absolutely believe in the power of tithing and giving back. My own experience about all the blessings I've had in my life is that the more I give away, the more that comes back. That is the way life works, and that is the way energy works.::Ken Blanchard
For a manager to be perceived as a positive manager, they need a four to one positive to negative contact ratio.::Ken Blanchard

In particular, for younger researchers on whom the future of mankind may depend. We believe that they are working with all the scientific wisdom at their disposal for the preservation of the inheritance of the earth and for the lasting survival of mankind.::Kenichi Fukui
We pray that every field of science may contribute in bringing happiness - not disaster - to human beings.::Kenichi Fukui
Some very famous directors have started in the mail room, which is just getting inside the studio, getting to know people, getting to know the routine.::Kenneth Anger

A careful inspection showed them that, even if they succeeded in righting it by themselves, the cart would travel no longer. The axles were in a hopeless state, and the missing wheel was shattered into pieces.::Kenneth Grahame
Now I say that if you run more than 15 miles a week, it's for something other than aerobic fitness. Once you pass 15 miles, you do not see much further improvement.::Kenneth H. Cooper
We are involved in youth testing internationally. We want to try to prove without a shadow of a doubt the relationship between physical fitness and health, not just physical fitness and ability to perform.::Kenneth H. Cooper
The reason I exercise is for the quality of life I enjoy.::Kenneth H. Cooper
Far too many times over the next 12 to 15 years, it was brought to my attention that people who followed my exercise guidelines exactly but ignored their diet, their weight and their cigarette smoking had heart attacks at age 55.::Kenneth H. Cooper
So I've broadened the fitness concept to make it one of moderation and balance.::Kenneth H. Cooper
There are six components of wellness: proper weight and diet, proper exercise, breaking the smoking habit, control of alcohol, stress management and periodic exams.::Kenneth H. Cooper
The power which establishes a state is violence the power which maintains it is violence the power which eventually overthrows it is violence.::Kenneth Kaunda
As for political poetry, as it's usually defined, it seems there's very little good political poetry.::Kenneth Koch
I love painting and music, of course. I don't know nearly as much about them as I know about poetry. I've certainly been influenced by fiction. I was overwhelmed by War and Peace when I read it, and I didn't read it until I was in my late 20s.::Kenneth Koch
I wonder if I ever thought of an ideal reader... I guess when I was in my 20s and in New York and maybe even in my early 30s, I would write for my wife Janice... mainly for my poet friends and my wife, who was very smart about poetry.::Kenneth Koch
The subject matter of the stories on the surface... there seem to be a number of stories about travel.::Kenneth Koch
Certainly, it seems true enough that there's a good deal of irony in the world... I mean, if you live in a world full of politicians and advertising, there's obviously a lot of deception.::Kenneth Koch
I was excited by what my painter friends were doing, and they seemed to be interested in our poetry too, and that was a wonderful little, fizzy sort of world.::Kenneth Koch
I was influenced by surrealist poetry and painting as were thousands of other people, and it seems to me to have become a part of the way I write, but it's not.::Kenneth Koch
Bader's philosophy was my philosophy. His whole attitude to life was mine.::Kenneth More
In the third century after Christ the faith continued to spread.::Kenneth Scott Latourette
That free will was demonstrated in the placing of temptation before man with the command not to eat of the fruit of the tree which would give him a knowledge of good and evil, with the disturbing moral conflict to which that awareness would give rise.::Kenneth Scott Latourette
The history of Christianity, therefore, must be of concern to all who are interested in the record of man and particularly to all who seek to understand the contemporary human scene.::Kenneth Scott Latourette
The most that one of Jewish faith can do - and some have gladly done it - is to say that Jesus was the greatest in the long succession of Jewish prophets. None can acknowledge that Jesus was the Messiah without becoming a Christian.::Kenneth Scott Latourette
Christianity emerged from the religion of Israel. Or rather, it has as its background a persistent strain in that religion. To that strain Christians have looked back, and rightly, as the preparation in history for their faith.::Kenneth Scott Latourette
The primary source of the appeal of Christianity was Jesus - His incarnation, His life, His crucifixion, and His resurrection.::Kenneth Scott Latourette
Christianity is usually called a religion. As a religion it has had a wider geographic spread and is more deeply rooted among more peoples than any other religion in the history of mankind.::Kenneth Scott Latourette
Religiously the Empire was pluralistic and marked by a search for a faith which would be satisfying intellectually and ethically and would give assurance of immortality.::Kenneth Scott Latourette
A critic is a man who knows the way but can't drive the car.::Kenneth Tynan
There is something permanent, and something extremely profound, in owning a home.::Kenny Guinn
I believe the best service to the child is the service closest to the child, and children who are victims of neglect, abuse, or abandonment must not also be victims of bureaucracy. They deserve our devoted attention, not our divided attention.::Kenny Guinn
There has to be chemistry in a duet, but if you go beyond the point of friendship and attraction, you lose something.::Kenny Rogers

The oppressed peoples can liberate themselves only through struggle. This is a simple and clear truth confirmed by history.::Kim Il-sung
Just touching that old tree was truly moving to me because when you touch these trees, you have such a sense of the passage of time, of history. It's like you're touching the essence, the very substance of life.::Kim Novak
I had a lot of resentment for a while toward Kim Novak. But I don't mind her anymore. She's okay. We've become friends. I even asked her before this trip for some beauty tips.::Kim Novak
I didn't want to travel. I didn't want to leave my family. I heard all these stories from Dad about not having Edward around when he was young, and I didn't want that to happen.::Kim Weston

No matter how fast I could do it with the digital camera I don't think I would get the same thing out of it. The passion I have for formulating an idea stands alone. It is the important essence of what I do.::Kim Weston
Uncle Brett had a definite vision that he was after, I don't think having a famous father affected him much.::Kim Weston
Growing up, I didn't give my grandfather's photography a second thought. I wasn't involved in his work, except that I helped my dad print his negatives.::Kim Weston
I felt no pressure that my grandfather was famous and my uncle was famous.::Kim Weston
As to those who hoard gold and silver and spend it not in God's path, give them, then, the tidings of a painful agony: on a day when these things shall be heated in hell-fire, and their foreheads, and their sides, and their backs shall be branded therewith.::Kin Hubbard

There is nothing like being left alone again, to walk peacefully with oneself in the woods. To boil one's coffee and fill one's pipe, and to think idly and slowly as one does it.::Knut Hamsun
However, I must not indulge in homespun wisdom here before so distinguished an assembly, especially as I am to be followed by a representative of science.::Knut Hamsun
I have had much to learn from Sweden's poetry and, more especially, from her lyrics of the last generation.::Knut Hamsun
No, what I should really like to do right now, in the full blaze of lights, before this illustrious assembly, is to shower every one of you with gifts, with flowers, with offerings of poetry - to be young once more, to ride on the crest of the wave.::Knut Hamsun

Since the composer has said everything, if you discover everything, it will be enough and you will be a happy man. Don't try to say it's your taste, and because of that you are changing this or that. And I must say this respect is still there.::Kurt Masur
I worked on scores. I went to the musical library in Berlin which is very famous. I discovered that we had scores of Beethoven, printed scores of Beethoven, that are full of mistakes. Not the wrong or false notes, but the wrong dynamic, understandable things.::Kurt Masur

If people think nature is their friend, then they sure don't need an enemy.::Kurt Vonnegut
Who is more to be pitied, a writer bound and gagged by policemen or one living in perfect freedom who has nothing more to say?::Kurt Vonnegut

The year was 2081, and everyone was finally equal.::Kurt Vonnegut

The best way of learning to be an independent sovereign state is to be an independent sovereign state.::Kwame Nkrumah

There is one type of ideal woman very seldom described in poetry - the old maid, the woman whom sorrow or misfortune prevents from fulfilling her natural destiny.::Lafcadio Hearn
It has been wisely observed by the greatest of modern thinkers that mankind has progressed more rapidly in every other respect than in morality.::Lafcadio Hearn
I often imagine that the longer he studies English literature the more the Japanese student must be astonished at the extraordinary predominance given to the passion of love both in fiction and in poetry.::Lafcadio Hearn
Perhaps there is an idea among Japanese students that one general difference between Japanese and Western poetry is that the former cultivates short forms and the latter longer ones, gut this is only in part true.::Lafcadio Hearn
It is true that short forms of poetry have been cultivated in the Far East more than in modern Europe but in all European literature short forms of poetry are to be found - indeed quite as short as anything in Japanese.::Lafcadio Hearn

A great many things which in times of lesser knowledge we imagined to be superstitious or useless, prove today on examination to have been of immense value to mankind.::Lafcadio Hearn
The subject of Finnish poetry ought to have a special interest for the Japanese student, if only for the reason that Finnish poetry comes more closely in many respects to Japanese poetry than any other form of Western poetry.::Lafcadio Hearn
Of course, the simple explanation of the fact is that marriage is the most important act of man's life in Europe or America, and that everything depends upon it.::Lafcadio Hearn
At last, in 1611, was made, under the auspices of King James, the famous King James version and this is the great literary monument of the English language.::Lafcadio Hearn

Hungary is, in a word, in a state of WAR against the Hapsburg dynasty, a war of legitimate defence, by which alone it can ever regain independence and freedom.::Lajos Kossuth
The power that is supported by force alone will have cause often to tremble.::Lajos Kossuth
Men like me, who merely wish to establish political freedom, will in such circumstances lose all their influence, and others will get influence who may become dangerous to all established interests whatsoever.::Lajos Kossuth
Be modest, be respectful of others, try to understand.::Lakhdar Brahimi
A fly cannot go in unless it stops somewhere therefore weapons, fuel, food, money will not go to Afghanistan unless the neighbors of Afghanistan are working, are cooperating, either being themselves the origin or the transit.::Lakhdar Brahimi
The mandate you go with is intimidating and also is a source of respect that you gain, because you have come with this mandate from the United Nations.::Lakhdar Brahimi

It's my firm intention to whop cancer into submission and I truly believe I've given myself the best start possible by radically overhauling my diet and by staying true to my motto, which is: Don't worry, be happy, feel good.

There are very little things in this life I cannot afford and patience is one of them.::Larry Hagman
If you do your research on hot springs all over the world, they're usually places of peace. People, even in warring nations and so forth, they'll go and live in peace together around the hot springs, which were always considered medicinal. I firmly believe in water therapy.::Larry Hagman
I never travel without my Stetson, but the more I wear it the more I realise that no one wears hats any more. When I was a kid everybody wore hats, especially in Texas, but I get off the plane in Dallas now and I'm the only guy with a hat. It's amazing.::Larry Hagman
When we started the show, 'Dallas' was known as the city where JFK was assassinated. By the end it was known as JR's home town.::Larry Hagman
Well I think they broke the mould when they made me and being humble is one of my great assets.::Larry Hagman
I'm sure it is, I'm not for any kind of war, we've been engaged in several wars since the second world war and we lost in Korea, we lost in Vietnam, they are political wars, they have nothing to do with any real threat, nor does this one.::Larry Hagman

I'd like to play Matt Damon's daddy. He's a wonderful actor, I really admire him, and I'd like to play his dad one day.::Larry Hagman
I think that everybody in the world, whatever colour or creed, has a jerk like JR in his or her family somewhere. Whether it is a father, uncle, cousin or brother, everybody can identify with JR and that certainly had something to do with the success of 'Dallas.'::Larry Hagman
Those who have succeeded at anything and don't mention luck are kidding themselves.::Larry King
If they asked me, I did two shifts. I did sports, I did news, because I loved it.::Larry King
I remind myself every morning: Nothing I say this day will teach me anything. So if I'm going to learn, I must do it by listening.::Larry King
No illusion is more crucial than the illusion that great success and huge money buy you immunity from the common ills of mankind, such as cars that won't start.::Larry McMurtry
You expect far too much of a first sentence. Think of it as analogous to a good country breakfast: what we want is something simple, but nourishing to the imagination.::Larry McMurtry
Follow the wisdom of the great actor, James Cagney, you hit your mark, you look the other guy in the eye, and you tell the truth.::Larry Merchant
I'd visit the near future, close enough that someone might want to talk to Larry Niven and can figure out the language distant enough to get me decent medical techniques and a ticket to the Moon.::Larry Niven
Building one space station for everyone was and is insane: we should have built a dozen.::Larry Niven
I'd repair our education system or replace it with something that works.::Larry Niven
In hindsight it may even seem inevitable that a socialist society will starve when it runs out of capitalists.::Larry Niven
Being a press secretary is like learning to type: You're hunting and pecking for a while and then you find yourself doing the touch system and don't realize it. You're speaking for the president without ever having to go to him.::Larry Speakes
That is to say, epic poetry has been invented many times and independently but, as the needs which prompted the invention have been broadly similar, so the invention itself has been.::Lascelles Abercrombie
Traditional matter must be glorified, since it would be easier to listen to the re-creation of familiar stories than to quite new and unexpected things the listeners, we must remember, needed poetry chiefly as the re-creation of tired hours.::Lascelles Abercrombie
There is only one thing which can master the perplexed stuff of epic material into unity and that is, an ability to see in particular human experience some significant symbolism of man's general destiny.::Lascelles Abercrombie
Poetry is the work of poets, not of peoples or communities artistic creation can never be anything but the production of an individual mind.::Lascelles Abercrombie
If epic poetry is a definite species, the sagas do not fall within it.::Lascelles Abercrombie
But the development of human society does not go straight forward and the epic process will therefore be a recurring process, the series a recurring series - though not in exact repetition.::Lascelles Abercrombie
The balance of private good and general welfare is at the bottom of civilized morals but the morals of the Heroic Age are founded on individuality, and on nothing else.::Lascelles Abercrombie
But the gravest difficulty, and perhaps the most important, in poetry meant solely for recitation, is the difficulty of achieving verbal beauty, or rather of making verbal beauty tell.::Lascelles Abercrombie
With several different kinds of poetry to choose from, a man would decide that he would like best to be an epic poet, and he would set out, in conscious determination, on an epic poem.::Lascelles Abercrombie
By the general process of epic poetry, I mean the way this form of art has constantly responded to the profound needs of the society in which it was made.::Lascelles Abercrombie
The Border Ballads, for instance, and the Robin Hood Ballads, clearly suppose a state of society which is nothing but a very circumscribed and not very important heroic age.::Lascelles Abercrombie
The reason can only be this: heroic poetry depends on an heroic age, and an age is heroic because of what it is, not because of what it does.::Lascelles Abercrombie
Epic poetry exhibits life in some great symbolic attitude. It cannot strictly be said to symbolize life itself, but always some manner of life.::Lascelles Abercrombie
Suffering passes, while love is eternal. That's a gift that you have received from God. Don't waste it.::Laura Ingalls Wilder
Every job is good if you do your best and work hard. A man who works hard stinks only to the ones that have nothing to do but smell.::Laura Ingalls Wilder
Remember me with smiles and laughter, for that is how I will remember you all. If you can only remember me with tears, then don't remember me at all.::Laura Ingalls Wilder
Poetry brings all possible experience to the same degree: a degree in the consciousness beyond which the consciousness itself cannot go.::Laura Riding
I feel an intense intimacy with those who have this loathing interest in me. Further than this, I know what they mean, I sympathize with them, I understand them. There should be a name (as poetic as love) for this relationship between loather and loathed it is of the closest and more full of passion than incest.::Laura Riding
To a poet the mere making of a poem can seem to solve the problem of truth, but only a problem of art is solved in poetry.::Laura Riding
Because most people are not sufficiently employed in themselves, they run about loose, hungering for employment, and satisfy themselves in various supererogatory occupations. The easiest of these occupations, which have all to do with making things already made, is the making of people: it is called the art of friendship.::Laura Riding
The end of poetry is not to create a physical condition which shall give pleasure to the mind... The end of poetry is not an after-effect, not a pleasurable memory of itself, but an immediate, constant and even unpleasant insistence upon itself.::Laura Riding
Patience was not my strong point.::Lauren Bacall
I put my career in second place throughout both my marriages and it suffered. I don't regret it. You make choices. If you want a good marriage, you must pay attention to that. If you want to be independent, go ahead. You can't have it all.::Lauren Bacall
We live in an age of mediocrity.::Lauren Bacall
I think your whole life shows in your face and you should be proud of that.::Lauren Bacall
When everything happens to you when you're so young, you're very lucky, but by the same token, you're never going to have that same feeling again. The first time anything happens to you - your first love, your first success - the second one is never the same.::Lauren Bacall
I figure if I have my health, can pay the rent and I have my friends, I call it 'content.'::Lauren Bacall
Imagination is the highest kite one can fly.::Lauren Bacall
It is the sincerest thing I have written, caught by the drama of a soul struggling in the contrary toils of love and religion - death brought them into harmony.::Laurence Housman
Suicide is possible, but not probable hanging, I trust, is even more unlikely for I hope that, by the time I die, my countrymen will have become civilised enough to abolish capital punishment.::Laurence Housman
I was just then going through a healthy reaction from the orthodoxy of my youth religion had become for me not so much a possession as an obsession, which I was trying to throw off, and this iconoclastic tale of an imaginary tribe was the result.::Laurence Housman
My failure, during the first five or six years of my art training, to get set in the right direction, and the disappointment which it caused me, drove me the more persistently into writing as an alternative.::Laurence Housman
The great question is not whether you have failed, but whether you are content with failure.::Laurence J. Peter
Speak when you are angry - and you'll make the best speech you'll ever regret.::Laurence J. Peter

Education is a method whereby one acquires a higher grade of prejudices.::Laurence J. Peter

I once asked a hermit in Italy how he could venture to live alone, in a single cottage, on the top of a mountain, a mile from any habitation? He replied, that Providence was his next-door neighbor.::Laurence Sterne
The desire of knowledge, like the thirst of riches, increases ever with the acquisition of it.::Laurence Sterne

I take a simple view of life. It is keep your eyes open and get on with it.::Laurence Sterne
Alas! if the principles of contentment are not within us, the height of station and worldly grandeur will as soon add a cubit to a man's stature as to his happiness.::Laurence Sterne
In solitude the mind gains strength and learns to lean upon itself.::Laurence Sterne
Respect for ourselves guides our morals, respect for others guides our manners.::Laurence Sterne
Men tire themselves in pursuit of rest.::Laurence Sterne
Lessons of wisdom have the most power over us when they capture the heart through the groundwork of a story, which engages the passions.::Laurence Sterne
Religion which lays so many restraints upon us, is a troublesome companion to those who will lay no restraints upon themselves.::Laurence Sterne
Personality is more important than beauty, but imagination is more important than both of them.::Laurette Taylor
What she did was to open our eyes to details of country life such as teaching us names of wild flowers and getting us to draw and paint and learn poetry.::Laurie Lee
To say I drank my way into marriage isn't much of an exaggeration, and it's none at all to say I drank my way out of it.::Lawrence Block
We are the children of a technological age. We have found streamlined ways of doing much of our routine work. Printing is no longer the only way of reproducing books. Reading them, however, has not changed.::Lawrence Clark Powell
To achieve lasting literature, fictional or factual, a writer needs perceptive vision, absorptive capacity, and creative strength.::Lawrence Clark Powell
The richest love is that which submits to the arbitration of time.::Lawrence Durrell
Music was invented to confirm human loneliness.::Lawrence Durrell
For us artists there waits the joyous compromise through art with all that wounded or defeated us in daily life in this way, not to evade destiny, as the ordinary people try to do, but to fulfil it in its true potential - the imagination.::Lawrence Durrell
I had become, with the approach of night, once more aware of loneliness and time - those two companions without whom no journey can yield us anything.::Lawrence Durrell
Travel can be one of the most rewarding forms of introspection.::Lawrence Durrell
Like all young men I set out to be a genius, but mercifully laughter intervened.::Lawrence Durrell
History is an endless repetition of the wrong way of living.::Lawrence Durrell
It is not love that is blind, but jealousy.::Lawrence Durrell
The appalling thing is the degree of charity women are capable of. You see it all the time... love lavished on absolute fools. Love's a charity ward, you know.::Lawrence Durrell
Old age is an insult. It's like being smacked.::Lawrence Durrell
I think what he's - what he believes, and he may be correct, I don't know, that we have some intelligence information that leads us to know some things about what's going on in Iraq that we haven't revealed to others.::Lawrence Eagleburger
We must advertise to U.S. business that we are there, that our attitude has changed, and that we care. When we are asked to help, we have to perform and provide the right advice.::Lawrence Eagleburger
One nuclear war is going to be the last nuclear - the last war, frankly, if it really gets out of hand. And I just don't think we ought to be prepared to accept that sort of thing.::Lawrence Eagleburger
To remove this obstacle I repeat or refer to such knowledge as has come under my notice, my own previously expressed views, and also describe and exhibit my last experiments and explain their novelty and utility.::Lawrence Hargrave
It becomes a giant's task to compute the result when the effect of cross seas, wind at all angles and ever varying force, arched surfaces, head resistance, ratio of weight to area, and the intelligence of the guiding power crop up.::Lawrence Hargrave
The most important thing you learn as a sports photographer is anticipation - not where the action is taking place, but where it's going to take place. Not where the subject is now, but where they're going to be.::Lawrence Schiller
Mattresses! Beautiful! Let's go buy a couple of mattresses. Give 'em to people for their birthday.::Lawrence Tierney

One time I introduced my orchestra as the Shampoo Music Makers instead of the Champagne Music Makers.::Lawrence Welk
Space and light and order. Those are the things that men need just as much as they need bread or a place to sleep.::Le Corbusier
The home should be the treasure chest of living.::Le Corbusier
Architecture is the learned game, correct and magnificent, of forms assembled in the light.::Le Corbusier
To create architecture is to put in order. Put what in order? Function and objects.::Le Corbusier
A house is a machine for living in.::Le Corbusier
I had a go at changing history - maybe not all by myself - I fought at the battle of Normandy, I slogged through the Ardennes, and I celebrated the liberation of Paris on the streets with beautiful French girls throwing flowers at me. I said good-bye to my first true love and discovered what I really wanted to do with my life.::LeRoy Neiman
Boxing is my real passion. I can go to ballet, theatre, movies, or other sporting events... and nothing is like the fights to me. I'm excited by the visual beauty of it. A boxer can look so spectacular by doing a good job.::LeRoy Neiman
No, I never had any dreams. The process of art is a dream in itself. The artist just doesn't... you work out something. It's yours. You don't have to go to sleep to do that. You do that on the canvas.::LeRoy Neiman
Imagination comes of not having things.::LeRoy Neiman
People break down after a couple of hours. All the defenses go down, and there's a kind of communication that if I spent 20 years in a living room with one of these people, I would never, never know as much about them as I do in that one day.::Lee Grant
People think I'm crazy because I travel too much, but I haven't been doing any of that lately because I got a little sick this year and I've tried to take care of it.::Lee Hazlewood
Talk to people in their own language. If you do it well, they'll say, 'God, he said exactly what I was thinking.' And when they begin to respect you, they'll follow you to the death.::Lee Iacocca
There is no substitute for accurate knowledge. Know yourself, know your business, know your men.::Lee Iacocca

My father always used to say that when you die, if you've got five real friends, then you've had a great life.::Lee Iacocca
One of the things the government can't do is run anything. The only things our government runs are the post office and the railroads, and both of them are bankrupt.::Lee Iacocca
There are times when even the best manager is like the little boy with the big dog, waiting to see where the dog wants to go so he can take him there.::Lee Iacocca
Apply yourself. Get all the education you can, but then, by God, do something. Don't just stand there, make it happen.::Lee Iacocca
The only rock I know that stays steady, the only institution I know that works, is the family.::Lee Iacocca
Start with good people, lay out the rules, communicate with your employees, motivate them and reward them. If you do all those things effectively, you can't miss.::Lee Iacocca
Motivation is everything. You can do the work of two people, but you can't be two people. Instead, you have to inspire the next guy down the line and get him to inspire his people.::Lee Iacocca
In a completely rational society, the best of us would be teachers and the rest of us would have to settle for something else.::Lee Iacocca
I forgot to shake hands and be friendly. It was an important lesson about leadership.::Lee Iacocca
No matter what you've done for yourself or for humanity, if you can't look back on having given love and attention to your own family, what have you really accomplished?::Lee Iacocca
I have found that being honest is the best technique I can use. Right up front, tell people what you're trying to accomplish and what you're willing to sacrifice to accomplish it.::Lee Iacocca
A guy named Charlie Beacham was my first mentor at Ford. He taught me the importance of the dealers, and he rubbed my nose in the retail business.::Lee Iacocca
In the end, all business operations can be reduced to three words: people, product, and profits.::Lee Iacocca
Management is nothing more than motivating other people.::Lee Iacocca
Every business and every product has risks. You can't get around it.::Lee Iacocca
I just completed a tour in Europe. I played every night. This requires traveling some days for six hours in a van or a train or a car. After six weeks of that, I checked into the hotel and just fell apart.::Lee Konitz
Labels don't mean anything to me. I'm trying to play as passionately as I'm able to. If they want to call that cool, that's fine. Just spell the name right, is the formula.::Lee Konitz
With Jackson there was quiet solitude. Just to sit and look at the landscape. An inner quietness. After dinner, to sit on the back porch and look at the light. No need for talking. For any kind of communication.::Lee Krasner
My own image of my work is that I no sooner settle into something than a break occurs. These breaks are always painful and depressing but despite them I see that there's a consistency that holds out, but is hard to define.::Lee Krasner
If you deprive yourself of outsourcing and your competitors do not, you're putting yourself out of business.::Lee Kuan Yew
I only make movies to finance my fishing'.::Lee Marvin
I met Jesse Owens once. He was a remarkable individual, and I have tremendous respect for what he did in the Olympics under the circumstances.::Lee Trevino

Golf isn't just my business, it's my hobby.::Lee Trevino
When you're poor, you know nothing about the future, you know nothing about the world, nothing that goes on outside 300 yards around you.::Lee Trevino
If you are caught on a golf course during a storm and are afraid of lightning, hold up a 1-iron. Not even God can hit a 1-iron.::Lee Trevino
My divorce came to me as a complete surprise. That's what happens when you haven't been home in eighteen years.::Lee Trevino
You can make a lot of money in this game. Just ask my ex-wives. Both of them are so rich that neither of their husbands work.::Lee Trevino
When you really deep down look at it, we go to bed every night, get up every morning, stay here for 70 or 80 years, and then we die.::Lee Trevino
I never played much golf as a kid. I caddied quite a bit but never got serious into golf until about age 15.::Lee Trevino
Only bad golfers are lucky. They're the ones bouncing balls off trees, curbs, turtles and cars. Good golfers have bad luck. When you hit the ball straight, a funny bounce is bound to be unlucky.::Lee Trevino
I've got a new invention. It's a revolving bowl for tired goldfish.::Lefty Gomez
I'm the guy that made Joe DiMaggio famous.::Lefty Gomez
Great woman belong to history and to self sacrifice.::Leigh Hunt
Colors are the smiles of nature.::Leigh Hunt
The same people who can deny others everything are famous for refusing themselves nothing.::Leigh Hunt
The groundwork of all happiness is health.::Leigh Hunt
There are two worlds: the world we can measure with line and rule, and the world that we feel with our hearts and imagination.::Leigh Hunt
If you are ever at a loss to support a flagging conversation, introduce the subject of eating.::Leigh Hunt
Government itself is founded upon the great doctrine of the consent of the governed, and has its cornerstone in the memorable principle that men are endowed with inalienable rights.::Leland Stanford
A man's sentiments are generally just and right, while it is second selfish thought which makes him trim and adopt some other view. The best reforms are worked out when sentiment operates, as it does in women, with the indignation of righteousness.::Leland Stanford
Each co-operative institution will become a school of business in which each member will acquire a knowledge of the laws of trade and commerce.::Leland Stanford
The rights of one sex, political and otherwise, are the same as those of the other sex, and this equality of rights ought to be fully recognized.::Leland Stanford
The employer class is less indispensable in the modern organization of industries because the laboring men themselves possess sufficient intelligence to organize into co-operative relation and enjoy the entire benefits of their own labor.::Leland Stanford
Many writers upon the science of political economy have declared that it is the duty of a nation first to encourage the creation of wealth and second, to direct and control its distribution. All such theories are delusive.::Leland Stanford
From my earliest acquaintance with the science of political economy, it has been evident to my mind that capital was the product of labor, and that therefore, in its best analysis there could be no natural conflict between capital and labor.::Leland Stanford
The right of each individual in any relation to secure to himself the full benefits of his intelligence, his capacity, his industry and skill are among the inalienable inheritances of humanity.::Leland Stanford
The employee is regarded by the employer merely in the light of his value as an operative. His productive capacity alone is taken into account.::Leland Stanford
I'm not alone, I'm free. I no longer have to be a credit, I don't have to be a symbol to anybody I don't have to be a first to anybody.::Lena Horne
Malcolm X made me very strong at a time I needed to understand what I was angry about. He had peace in his heart. He exerted a big influence on me.::Lena Horne
Every color I can think of and nationality, we were all touched by Dr. King because he made us like each other and respect each other.::Lena Horne
Always be smarter than the people who hire you.::Lena Horne
Don't be afraid to feel as angry or as loving as you can, because when you feel nothing, it's just death.::Lena Horne
I'm still learning, you know. At 80, I feel there is a lot I don't know.::Lena Horne
The applause was so loud and insistent that I had to respond with several encores. I was numb with happiness, when it was over, I knew that this alone must be my life and my world.::Leni Riefenstahl
Through my optimism I naturally prefer and capture the beauty in life.::Leni Riefenstahl
Looking in the mirror to check if my tie is straight is a waste of my time. I only look in the mirror once a day, and that's in the morning when I shave.::Lennart Meri
And my real enemy is not to hold the specimen sterile, but it's the lighting. The light is our real enemy. So we have to work with very very poor lighting. But we can increase the light with computers.::Lennart Nilsson
That's the new way - with computers, computers, computers. That's the way we can have the cell survive and get some new information in high resolution. We started about five years ago and, today, I think we have reached the target.::Lennart Nilsson
I have many times thought I did the wrong thing, but the reason was not to be a medical doctor - it was just to have the information. But then, maybe I was wrong, I don't know.::Lennart Nilsson
I have the instruments, ideas, technology, computer techniques. We try to create or see something, which has not been known before - just to discover something together. This is always my dream.::Lennart Nilsson
The only honest art form is laughter, comedy. You can't fake it... try to fake three laughs in an hour - ha ha ha ha ha - they'll take you away, man. You can't.::Lenny Bruce

We should never discourage young people from dreaming dreams.::Lenny Wilkens
If you don't get noticed, you don't have anything. You just have to be noticed, but the art is in getting noticed naturally, without screaming or without tricks.::Leo Burnett
Creative ideas flourish best in a shop which preserves some spirit of fun. Nobody is in business for fun, but that does not mean there cannot be fun in business.::Leo Burnett
A good basic selling idea, involvement and relevancy, of course, are as important as ever, but in the advertising din of today, unless you make yourself noticed and believed, you ain't got nothin'.::Leo Burnett
I have learned to respect ideas, wherever they come from. Often they come from clients. Account executives often have big creative ideas, regardless of what some writers think.::Leo Burnett
The work of an advertising agency is warmly and immediately human. It deals with human needs, wants, dreams and hopes. Its 'product' cannot be turned out on an assembly line.::Leo Burnett
I am one who believes that one of the greatest dangers of advertising is not that of misleading people, but that of boring them to death.::Leo Burnett
What helps people, helps business.::Leo Burnett
I have a very strong feeling that the opposite of love is not hate - it's apathy. It's not giving a damn.::Leo Buscaglia
Love is always open arms. If you close your arms about love you will find that you are left holding only yourself.::Leo Buscaglia
Love is always bestowed as a gift - freely, willingly and without expectation. We don't love to be loved we love to love.::Leo Buscaglia
Change is the end result of all true learning.::Leo Buscaglia

A single rose can be my garden... a single friend, my world.::Leo Buscaglia
Only the weak are cruel. Gentleness can only be expected from the strong.::Leo Buscaglia
Don't brood. Get on with living and loving. You don't have forever.::Leo Buscaglia
The fact that I can plant a seed and it becomes a flower, share a bit of knowledge and it becomes another's, smile at someone and receive a smile in return, are to me continual spiritual exercises.::Leo Buscaglia
I've always thought that people need to feel good about themselves and I see my role as offering support to them, to provide some light along the way.::Leo Buscaglia
If I don't have wisdom, I can teach you only ignorance.::Leo Buscaglia
I believe that you control your destiny, that you can be what you want to be. You can also stop and say, 'No, I won't do it, I won't behave his way anymore. I'm lonely and I need people around me, maybe I have to change my methods of behaving,' and then you do it.::Leo Buscaglia
Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around.::Leo Buscaglia
I still get wildly enthusiastic about little things... I play with leaves. I skip down the street and run against the wind.::Leo Buscaglia
What we call the secret of happiness is no more a secret than our willingness to choose life.::Leo Buscaglia
Your talent is God's gift to you. What you do with it is your gift back to God.::Leo Buscaglia
If we wish to free ourselves from enslavement, we must choose freedom and the responsibility this entails.::Leo Buscaglia
What love we've given, we'll have forever. What love we fail to give, will be lost for all eternity.::Leo Buscaglia
Love always creates, it never destroys. In this lie's man's only promise.::Leo Buscaglia
It is paradoxical that many educators and parents still differentiate between a time for learning and a time for play without seeing the vital connection between them.::Leo Buscaglia
Love is life. And if you miss love, you miss life.::Leo Buscaglia
Death is a challenge. It tells us not to waste time... It tells us to tell each other right now that we love each other.::Leo Buscaglia
The design of each element should be thought out in order to be easy to make and easy to repair.::Leo Fender
It is easy to believe in freedom of speech for those with whom we agree.::Leo McKern
A conservative is one who admires radicals centuries after they're dead.::Leo Rosten
Courage is the capacity to confront what can be imagined.::Leo Rosten
I learned that it is the weak who are cruel, and that gentleness is to be expected only from the strong.::Leo Rosten
Happiness comes only when we push our brains and hearts to the farthest reaches of which we are capable.::Leo Rosten
Humor is the affectionate communication of insight.::Leo Rosten
Extremists think 'communication' means agreeing with them.::Leo Rosten
If the highest things are unknowable, then the highest capacity or virtue of man cannot be theoretical wisdom.::Leo Strauss
All happy families resemble one another, each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.::Leo Tolstoy
Even in the valley of the shadow of death, two and two do not make six.::Leo Tolstoy
All, everything that I understand, I understand only because I love.::Leo Tolstoy
Art is not a handicraft, it is the transmission of feeling the artist has experienced.::Leo Tolstoy
Government is an association of men who do violence to the rest of us.::Leo Tolstoy
The chief difference between words and deeds is that words are always intended for men for their approbation, but deeds can be done only for God.::Leo Tolstoy
The changes in our life must come from the impossibility to live otherwise than according to the demands of our conscience not from our mental resolution to try a new form of life.::Leo Tolstoy
A man can live and be healthy without killing animals for food therefore, if he eats meat, he participates in taking animal life merely for the sake of his appetite.::Leo Tolstoy
Our body is a machine for living. It is organized for that, it is its nature. Let life go on in it unhindered and let it defend itself.::Leo Tolstoy
Faith is the sense of life, that sense by virtue of which man does not destroy himself, but continues to live on. It is the force whereby we live.::Leo Tolstoy
The greater the state, the more wrong and cruel its patriotism, and the greater is the sum of suffering upon which its power is founded.::Leo Tolstoy
War on the other hand is such a terrible thing, that no man, especially a Christian man, has the right to assume the responsibility of starting it.::Leo Tolstoy
Truth, like gold, is to be obtained not by its growth, but by washing away from it all that is not gold.::Leo Tolstoy
True life is lived when tiny changes occur.::Leo Tolstoy
If there existed no external means for dimming their consciences, one-half of the men would at once shoot themselves, because to live contrary to one's reason is a most intolerable state, and all men of our time are in such a state.::Leo Tolstoy
In the name of God, stop a moment, cease your work, look around you.::Leo Tolstoy
If you want to be happy, be.::Leo Tolstoy
To say that a work of art is good, but incomprehensible to the majority of men, is the same as saying of some kind of food that it is very good but that most people can't eat it.::Leo Tolstoy
All violence consists in some people forcing others, under threat of suffering or death, to do what they do not want to do.::Leo Tolstoy
It is amazing how complete is the delusion that beauty is goodness.::Leo Tolstoy
Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself.::Leo Tolstoy
Music is the shorthand of emotion.::Leo Tolstoy
Without knowing what I am and why I am here, life is impossible.::Leo Tolstoy
If so many men, so many minds, certainly so many hearts, so many kinds of love.::Leo Tolstoy
The two most powerful warriors are patience and time.::Leo Tolstoy
There is no greatness where there is no simplicity, goodness and truth.::Leo Tolstoy
One of the first conditions of happiness is that the link between Man and Nature shall not be broken.::Leo Tolstoy
In all history there is no war which was not hatched by the governments, the governments alone, independent of the interests of the people, to whom war is always pernicious even when successful.::Leo Tolstoy
War is so unjust and ugly that all who wage it must try to stifle the voice of conscience within themselves.::Leo Tolstoy
1988 I also received from the city of Vienna the cross of honour for art and science. These titles and the various honors mean a great deal to me, most of all for the reason that they would mean a great deal to my parents too.::Leon Askin
In the morning we received some very thin coffee. For lunch we had potato soup with a few pieces of meat in it, in the evening we had a very thin meat soup with some potatoes in it.::Leon Askin
When I investigate and when I discover that the forces of the heavens and the planets are within ourselves, then truly I seem to be living among the gods.::Leon Battista Alberti
Beauty: the adjustment of all parts proportionately so that one cannot add or subtract or change without impairing the harmony of the whole.::Leon Battista Alberti
The answer to old age is to keep one's mind busy and to go on with one's life as if it were interminable. I always admired Chekhov for building a new house when he was dying of tuberculosis.::Leon Edel
There is a lot of hype and fear about this much-talked-about prospect of designer babies.::Leon Kass
If you have easy self-contentment, you might have a very, very cheap source of happiness.::Leon Kass
I have nothing against respecting people who lived before, but we have no responsibility toward them.::Leon Kass
There were certain questions about the foundations of morals that advances in science all threaten to make more complicated.::Leon Kass
It's very hard to make arguments about the effects of cloning on family relations if family relations are in tatters.::Leon Kass
Biology, meaning the science of all life, is a late notion.::Leon Kass
Many people recognize that technology often comes with unintended and undesirable side effects.::Leon Kass
You know, as director of the CIA, I got an awful lot of intelligence about all the horrible things that could go on across the world.::Leon Panetta
Winning in Afghanistan is having a country that is stable enough to ensure that there is no safe haven for Al Qaida or for a militant Taliban that welcomes Al Qaida. That's really the measure of success for the United States.::Leon Panetta
Today, I think the attitude is that governing is not necessarily good politics, and the result is that it's much more partisan and much more divided.::Leon Panetta
After every major conflict - World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the fall of the Soviet Union - what happened was that we ultimately hollowed out the force, largely by doing deep across-the-board cuts.::Leon Panetta
Well look, CIA is an agency that has to collect intelligence, do operations. We have to take risks and it's important that we take risks and that we know that we have the support of the government and we have the support of the American people in what we're doing.::Leon Panetta
Life is not an easy matter... You cannot live through it without falling into frustration and cynicism unless you have before you a great idea which raises you above personal misery, above weakness, above all kinds of perfidy and baseness.::Leon Trotsky
There are no absolute rules of conduct, either in peace or war. Everything depends on circumstances.::Leon Trotsky
The historic ascent of humanity, taken as a whole, may be summarized as a succession of victories of consciousness over blind forces - in nature, in society, in man himself.::Leon Trotsky
There is a limit to the application of democratic methods. You can inquire of all the passengers as to what type of car they like to ride in, but it is impossible to question them as to whether to apply the brakes when the train is at full speed and accident threatens.::Leon Trotsky
Old age is the most unexpected of all things that happen to a man.::Leon Trotsky
The depth and strength of a human character are defined by its moral reserves. People reveal themselves completely only when they are thrown out of the customary conditions of their life, for only then do they have to fall back on their reserves.::Leon Trotsky
Learning carries within itself certain dangers because out of necessity one has to learn from one's enemies.::Leon Trotsky
I am very proud of this work because it is more about the meaning of the Easter Rising and its relationship to what this whole century has been about, people liberating themselves, freeing themselves.::Leon Uris
I think it has other roots, has to do, in part, with a general anxiety in contemporary life... nuclear bombs, inequality of possibility and chance, inequality of goods allotted to us, a kind of general racist, unjust attitude that is pervasive.::Leonard Baskin
Of course, I did lots of what would be called graphic design now, what used to be called commercial art.::Leonard Baskin
This will be our reply to violence: to make music more intensely, more beautifully, more devotedly than ever before.::Leonard Bernstein
Technique is communication: the two words are synonymous in conductors.::Leonard Bernstein

Music can name the unnameable and communicate the unknowable.::Leonard Bernstein
Our nation was founded on the principals of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.::Leonard Boswell
As the third anniversary of the September 11th attacks draws near we must ensure our nation is prepared to handle the continued threat of violence and terrorism on our country.::Leonard Boswell
The 9\/11 Commission strongly recommends that the National Intelligence Director be fully in control of the budget, from developing it to implementing it, to ensuring that the National Intelligence Director has the clout to make decisions.::Leonard Boswell
The National Intelligence Director needs the authority to do the job we are asking him to do. That means power over the intelligence budget. And to be effective, to be allowed to do his or her job, they must have authority over the budget.::Leonard Boswell
The March on Washington affirmed our values as a people: equality and opportunity for all. Forty-one years ago, during a time of segregation, these were an ideal.::Leonard Boswell
I am committed to ensure that our intelligence community, law enforcement, medical professionals, and military have the information and funding needed to protect the American people from threats at home and abroad.::Leonard Boswell
We must ensure that every worker has healthcare and is able to save for their retirement. We must ensure that our workers have safe and health working conditions.::Leonard Boswell
The 9\/11 Commission recently released their report, citing important changes which need to be made to improve our nation's homeland security. I voiced my disappointment with the House leadership when this report was left until after the August recess for action.::Leonard Boswell
Let judges secretly despair of justice: their verdicts will be more acute. Let generals secretly despair of triumph killing will be defamed. Let priests secretly despair of faith: their compassion will be true.::Leonard Cohen
And most people have a woman in their heart, most men have a woman in their heart and most women have a man in their heart.::Leonard Cohen
Women stand for the objective world for a man. They stand for the thing that you're not and that's what you always reach for in a song.::Leonard Cohen
I always thought that poetry is the verdict that others give to a certain kind of writing. So to call yourself a poet is a kind of dangerous description. It's for others it's for others to use.::Leonard Cohen
I think the term poet is a very exalted term and should be applied to a man at the end of his work. When he looks back over the body of his work and he's written poetry then let the verdict be that he's a poet.::Leonard Cohen
We used to play music for fun. Much more than now. Now nobody picks up a guitar unless they're paid for it.::Leonard Cohen
Success is survival.::Leonard Cohen
I never really liked poetry readings I liked to read poetry by myself, but I liked singing, chanting my lyrics to this jazz group.::Leonard Cohen
Music is the emotional life of most people.::Leonard Cohen
To every people the land is given on condition. Perceived or not, there is a Covenant, beyond the constitution, beyond sovereign guarantee, beyond the nation's sweetest dreams of itself.::Leonard Cohen
In dreams the truth is learned that all good works are done in the absence of a caress.::Leonard Cohen
Poetry is just the evidence of life. If your life is burning well, poetry is just the ash.::Leonard Cohen
I think it's my adventure, my trip, my journey, and I guess my attitude is, let the chips fall where they may.::Leonard Nimoy
Logic is the beginning of wisdom, not the end.::Leonard Nimoy
Experience does not err. Only your judgments err by expecting from her what is not in her power.::Leonardo da Vinci
Anyone who conducts an argument by appealing to authority is not using his intelligence he is just using his memory.::Leonardo da Vinci
He who is fixed to a star does not change his mind.::Leonardo da Vinci
Although nature commences with reason and ends in experience it is necessary for us to do the opposite, that is to commence with experience and from this to proceed to investigate the reason.::Leonardo da Vinci
The greatest deception men suffer is from their own opinions.::Leonardo da Vinci
Time stays long enough for anyone who will use it.::Leonardo da Vinci
While I thought that I was learning how to live, I have been learning how to die.::Leonardo da Vinci
All our knowledge has its origins in our perceptions.::Leonardo da Vinci
The smallest feline is a masterpiece.::Leonardo da Vinci
The human foot is a masterpiece of engineering and a work of art.::Leonardo da Vinci
In rivers, the water that you touch is the last of what has passed and the first of that which comes so with present time.::Leonardo da Vinci
Where there is shouting, there is no true knowledge.::Leonardo da Vinci
Where the spirit does not work with the hand, there is no art.::Leonardo da Vinci
Men of lofty genius when they are doing the least work are most active.::Leonardo da Vinci
Our life is made by the death of others.::Leonardo da Vinci
Just as courage imperils life, fear protects it.::Leonardo da Vinci
Marriage is like putting your hand into a bag of snakes in the hope of pulling out an eel.::Leonardo da Vinci
Human subtlety will never devise an invention more beautiful, more simple or more direct than does nature because in her inventions nothing is lacking, and nothing is superfluous.::Leonardo da Vinci
I love those who can smile in trouble, who can gather strength from distress, and grow brave by reflection. 'Tis the business of little minds to shrink, but they whose heart is firm, and whose conscience approves their conduct, will pursue their principles unto death.::Leonardo da Vinci
Why does the eye see a thing more clearly in dreams than the imagination when awake?::Leonardo da Vinci
Life is pretty simple: You do some stuff. Most fails. Some works. You do more of what works. If it works big, others quickly copy it. Then you do something else. The trick is the doing something else.::Leonardo da Vinci
Nature never breaks her own laws.::Leonardo da Vinci
Water is the driving force of all nature.::Leonardo da Vinci
Art is never finished, only abandoned.::Leonardo da Vinci
Beyond a doubt truth bears the same relation to falsehood as light to darkness.::Leonardo da Vinci
Life well spent is long.::Leonardo da Vinci
A well-spent day brings happy sleep.::Leonardo da Vinci
Learning never exhausts the mind.::Leonardo da Vinci
The truth of things is the chief nutriment of superior intellects.::Leonardo da Vinci
As a well-spent day brings happy sleep, so a life well spent brings happy death.::Leonardo da Vinci
I have offended God and mankind because my work didn't reach the quality it should have.::Leonardo da Vinci
A painter paints his pictures on canvas. But musicians paint their pictures on silence. We provide the music, and you provide the silence.::Leopold Stokowski
There's a certain amount of sympathy here for the Bush administration's problem, which is they would like to get rid of Saddam Hussein and they would like to have the Kurds autonomous.::Les Aspin
We ought to be providing protective sanctuaries for the Kurdish rebels. That means finding some places where they can come and to which we will then be able to provide food and water and medical help.::Les Aspin
Regardless of who originally made it popular, any hit song becomes a challenge to the ingenuity and imagination of other musicians and performers.::Les Baxter
Any good music must be an innovation.::Les Baxter
Marriage is an institution and that's where a couple finish up.::Les Dawson
I saw six men kicking and punching the mother-in-law. My neighbour said 'Are you going to help?' I said 'No, six should be enough.'::Les Dawson
I used to sell furniture for a living. The trouble was, it was my own.::Les Dawson
Now I need to take a piece of wood and make it sound like the railroad track, but I also had to make it beautiful and lovable so that a person playing it would think of it in terms of his mistress, a bartender, his wife, a good psychiatrist - whatever.::Les Paul
In all honesty, at that time, I never saw myself as an author... I was just a Mom in a state of panic, trying to enter a short story contest to win the prize money in order to keep the lights on in my home.::Leslie Banks
I love the paranormal, because there, every genre I write can become one beacon for my imagination.::Leslie Banks
The American is wholeheartedly for love and romance at any cost.::Leslie Caron
In order to have great happiness you have to have great pain and unhappiness - otherwise how would you know when you're happy?::Leslie Caron
Hemingway seems to be in a funny position. People nowadays can't identify with him closely as a member of their own generation, and he isn't yet historical.::Leslie Fiedler
Faulkner turned out to be a great teacher. When a student asked a question ineptly, he answered the question with what the student had really wanted to know.::Leslie Fiedler
I think the pattern of my essays is, A funny thing happened to me on my way through Finnegans Wake.::Leslie Fiedler
I long for the raised voice, the howl of rage or love.::Leslie Fiedler
I have, I admit, a low tolerance for detached chronicling and cool analysis.::Leslie Fiedler
My assignment is what every writer's assignment is: tell the truth of his own time.::Leslie Fiedler
All good criticism should be judged the way art is. You shouldn't read it the way you read history or science.::Leslie Fiedler
It's funny to be a critic.::Leslie Fiedler
When I was 12 years old, someone took me to see Martha Graham. It was nothing like what I thought of as serious dancing and even then I knew I was having a great experience. It was as if somebody was moving through space like no one ever did before.::Leslie Fiedler
I had to weave and play around with a honey bear, you know, and I could wrestle with him a little bit, but there's no way you can even wrestle a honey bear, let alone a grizzly bear that's standing ten feet to eleven feet tall! Can you imagine? But it was fascinating to work that close to that kind of animal.::Leslie Nielsen
I've always been part of comedy. One of the things about our family was that if we were reasonably funny with each other, particularly my two brothers and myself, when my father was upset with something you'd want to make sure in some way you made him laugh. Because when he didn't laugh, you were in trouble!::Leslie Nielsen
Of all our dreams today there is none more important - or so hard to realise - than that of peace in the world. May we never lose our faith in it or our resolve to do everything that can be done to convert it one day into reality.::Lester B. Pearson
The grim fact is that we prepare for war like precocious giants, and for peace like retarded pygmies.::Lester B. Pearson
True there has been more talk of peace since 1945 than, I should think, at any other time in history. At least we hear more and read more about it because man's words, for good or ill, can now so easily reach the millions.::Lester B. Pearson
Politics is the skilled use of blunt objects.::Lester B. Pearson
I cannot think of anything more difficult than to say something which would be worthy of this impressive and, for me, memorable occasion, and of the ideals and purposes which inspired the Nobel Peace Award.::Lester B. Pearson
It would be especially tragic if the people who most cherish ideals of peace, who are most anxious for political cooperation on a wider than national scale, made the mistake of underestimating the pace of economic change in our modern world.::Lester B. Pearson
The choice, however, is as clear now for nations as it was once for the individual: peace or extinction.::Lester B. Pearson
The stark and inescapable fact is that today we cannot defend our society by war since total war is total destruction, and if war is used as an instrument of policy, eventually we will have total war.::Lester B. Pearson
But while we all pray for peace, we do not always, as free citizens, support the policies that make for peace or reject those which do not. We want our own kind of peace, brought about in our own way.::Lester B. Pearson
It has too often been too easy for rulers and governments to incite man to war.::Lester B. Pearson
And I have lived since - as you have - in a period of cold war, during which we have ensured by our achievements in the science and technology of destruction that a third act in this tragedy of war will result in the peace of extinction.::Lester B. Pearson
As for the promotion of peace congresses we have had our meetings and assemblies, but the promotion through them of the determined and effective will to peace displaying itself in action and policy remains to be achieved.::Lester B. Pearson
I am grateful for the opportunities I have been given to participate in that work as a representative of my country, Canada, whose people have, I think, shown their devotion to peace.::Lester B. Pearson
As a soldier, I survived World War I when most of my comrades did not.::Lester B. Pearson
That's part of American greatness, is discrimination. Yes, sir. Inequality, I think, breeds freedom and gives a man opportunity.::Lester Maddox
How disappointment tracks the steps of hope.::Letitia Elizabeth Landon
Although Freud said happiness is composed of love and work, reality often forces us to choose love or work.::Letty Cottin Pogrebin
I personally have always found the Unitarian faith a source of comfort and help in my daily life.::Leverett Saltonstall
Beauty is altogether in the eye of the beholder.::Lew Wallace
We had an interesting thing at that first dinner. It was prior to the availability of several new hotels in Los Angeles, and we were more or less committed to the old Ambassador Hotel that has the famous Coconut Grove.::Lew Wasserman
Forgiving does not erase the bitter past. A healed memory is not a deleted memory. Instead, forgiving what we cannot forget creates a new way to remember. We change the memory of our past into a hope for our future.::Lewis B. Smedes
You will know that forgiveness has begun when you recall those who hurt you and feel the power to wish them well.::Lewis B. Smedes
It takes one person to forgive, it takes two people to be reunited.::Lewis B. Smedes
To forgive is to set a prisoner free and discover that the prisoner was you.::Lewis B. Smedes
Who in the world am I? Ah, that's the great puzzle.::Lewis Carroll
'The time has come,' the walrus said, 'to talk of many things: of shoes and ships - and sealing wax - of cabbages and kings.'::Lewis Carroll
It's a poor sort of memory that only works backwards.::Lewis Carroll
There comes a pause, for human strength will not endure to dance without cessation and everyone must reach the point at length of absolute prostration.::Lewis Carroll
She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it).::Lewis Carroll
There are three hundred and sixty-four days when you might get un-birthday presents, and only one for birthday presents, you know.::Lewis Carroll
While the laughter of joy is in full harmony with our deeper life, the laughter of amusement should be kept apart from it. The danger is too great of thus learning to look at solemn things in a spirit of mockery, and to seek in them opportunities for exercising wit.::Lewis Carroll
One of the secrets of life is that all that is really worth the doing is what we do for others.::Lewis Carroll
Always speak the truth, think before you speak, and write it down afterwards.::Lewis Carroll
Unlike any other business in the United States, sports must preserve an illusion of perfect innocence.::Lewis H. Lapham
Leadership consists not in degrees of technique but in traits of character it requires moral rather than athletic or intellectual effort, and it imposes on both leader and follower alike the burdens of self-restraint.::Lewis H. Lapham
A journey by Sea and Land, Five Hundred Miles, is not undertaken without money.::Lewis Hallam
One of the functions of intelligence is to take account of the dangers that come from trusting solely to the intelligence.::Lewis Mumford
Traditionalists are pessimists about the future and optimists about the past.::Lewis Mumford
The earth is the Lord's fullness thereof: this is no longer a hollow dictum of religion, but a directive for economic action toward human brotherhood.::Lewis Mumford
A man of courage never needs weapons, but he may need bail.::Lewis Mumford
The chief function of the city is to convert power into form, energy into culture, dead matter into the living symbols of art, biological reproduction into social creativity.::Lewis Mumford
Without fullness of experience, length of days is nothing. When fullness of life has been achieved, shortness of days is nothing. That is perhaps why the young have usually so little fear of death they live by intensities that the elderly have forgotten.::Lewis Mumford
The way people in democracies think of the government as something different from themselves is a real handicap. And, of course, sometimes the government confirms their opinion.::Lewis Mumford
However far modern science and techniques have fallen short of their inherent possibilities, they have taught mankind at least one lesson nothing is impossible.::Lewis Mumford
The artist does not illustrate science (but) he frequently responds to the same interests that a scientist does.::Lewis Mumford
Our national flower is the concrete cloverleaf.::Lewis Mumford
War is the supreme drama of a completely mechanized society.::Lewis Mumford
Life is the only art that we are required to practice without preparation, and without being allowed the preliminary trials, the failures and botches, that are essential for training.::Lewis Mumford
A day spent without the sight or sound of beauty, the contemplation of mystery, or the search of truth or perfection is a poverty-stricken day and a succession of such days is fatal to human life.::Lewis Mumford
Forget the damned motor car and build the cities for lovers and friends.::Lewis Mumford
Restore human legs as a means of travel. Pedestrians rely on food for fuel and need no special parking facilities.::Lewis Mumford
The dilemma of modern medicine, and the underlying central flaw in medical education and, most of all, in the training of interns, is the irresistible drive to do something, anything. It is expected by patients and too often agreed to by their doctors, in the face of ignorance.::Lewis Thomas
We are, perhaps, uniquely among the earth's creatures, the worrying animal. We worry away our lives, fearing the future, discontent with the present, unable to take in the idea of dying, unable to sit still.::Lewis Thomas
If you want to use a cliche you must take full responsibility for it yourself and not try to fob it off on anon., or on society.::Lewis Thomas
I won't compare ants and people, but ants give us a useful model of how single members of a community can become so organized that they end up resembling, in effect, one big collective brain. Our own exploding population and communication technology are leading us that way.::Lewis Thomas
Ants are so much like human beings as to be an embarrassment. They farm fungi, raise aphids as livestock, launch armies into war, use chemical sprays to alarm and confuse enemies, capture slaves, engage in child labour, exchange information ceaselessly. They do everything but watch television.::Lewis Thomas
The most solid piece of scientific truth I know of is that we are profoundly ignorant about nature.::Lewis Thomas
Our behavior toward each other is the strangest, most unpredictable, and most unaccountable of all the phenomena with which we are obliged to live. In all of nature, there is nothing so threatening to humanity as humanity itself.::Lewis Thomas
The great secret of doctors, known only to their wives, but still hidden from the public, is that most things get better by themselves most things, in fact, are better in the morning.::Lewis Thomas
The cloning of humans is on most of the lists of things to worry about from Science, along with behaviour control, genetic engineering, transplanted heads, computer poetry and the unrestrained growth of plastic flowers.::Lewis Thomas
There's really no such thing as the agony of dying. I'm quite sure that pain is shut off at the moment of death. You see, something happens when the body knows it's about to go. Peptide hormones are released by cells in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. Endorphins.::Lewis Thomas
Doctors, dressed up in one professional costume or another, have been in busy practice since the earliest records of every culture on earth. It is hard to think of a more dependable or enduring occupation, harder still to imagine any future events leading to its extinction.::Lewis Thomas
It is only when you watch the dense mass of thousands of ants, crowded together around the Hill, blackening the ground, that you begin to see the whole beast, and now you observe it thinking, planning, calculating. It is an intelligence, a kind of live computer, with crawling bits for its wits.::Lewis Thomas
A multitude of bees can tell the time of day, calculate the geometry of the sun's position, argue about the best location for the next swarm. Bees do a lot of close observing of other bees maybe they know what follows stinging and do it anyway.::Lewis Thomas
The future is too interesting and dangerous to be entrusted to any predictable, reliable agency. We need all the fallibility we can get. Most of all, we need to preserve the absolute unpredictability and total improbability of our connected minds. That way we can keep open all the options, as we have in the past.::Lewis Thomas
Very few recognize science as the high adventure it really is, the wildest of all explorations ever taken by human beings, the chance to glimpse things never seen before, the shrewdest maneuver for discovering how the world works.::Lewis Thomas
The central task of science is to arrive, stage by stage, at a clearer comprehension of nature, but this does not at all mean, as it is sometimes claimed to mean, a search for mastery over nature.::Lewis Thomas
I don't want to be reincarnated, that's for sure. When you've had rewarding experiences in your life - a loving family, friends - you don't need additional reassurances that you're going to do something with a new cast of characters. I'd just as soon pass.::Lewis Thomas
It is from the progeny of this parent cell that we all take our looks we still share genes around, and the resemblance of the enzymes of grasses to those of whales is in fact a family resemblance.::Lewis Thomas
A lot of people fear death because they think that so overwhelming an experience has to be painful, but I've seen quite a few deaths, and, with one exception, I've never known anyone to undergo anything like agony. That's amazing when you think about it. I mean, how complicated the mechanism is that's being taken apart.::Lewis Thomas
Survival, in the cool economics of biology, means simply the persistence of one's own genes in the generations to follow.::Lewis Thomas
Music is the effort we make to explain to ourselves how our brains work. We listen to Bach transfixed because this is listening to a human mind.::Lewis Thomas
We're as clever as we think we are, but we'll be a lot cleverer when we learn to use not just one brain but to pool huge numbers of brains. We're at a level technologically where we can share information and think collectively about our problems. We do it in science all the time - there's no reason why we can't do it in other endeavors.::Lewis Thomas
Much of today's public anxiety about science is the apprehension that we may forever be overlooking the whole by an endless, obsessive preoccupation with the parts.::Lewis Thomas
At this early stage in our evolution, now through our infancy and into our childhood and then, with luck, our growing up, what our species needs most of all, right now, is simply a future.::Lewis Thomas
I suggest that the introductory courses in science, at all levels from grade school through college, be radically revised. Leave the fundamentals, the so-called basics, aside for a while, and concentrate the attention of all students on the things that are not known.::Lewis Thomas
Comrade Deng Xiaoping - along with other party elders - gave the party leadership their firm and full support to put down the political disturbance using forceful measures.::Li Peng
At the beginning of the new century, it is the common aspiration of the peoples of the two countries to deepen mutual understanding, enhance trust, develop friendship and strengthen cooperation.::Li Peng
We sincerely hope that south Asian countries will respect and live in amity with each other, and achieve common development, and that south Asia will enjoy peace, stability and prosperity.::Li Peng
We support every effort to combat international terrorism through the formulation of international conventions and hope that the international community will take further steps to improve the anti-terrorism international legal framework.::Li Peng
When the traveler goes alone he gets acquainted with himself.::Liberty Hyde Bailey
Anyone who acquires more than the usual amount of knowledge concerning a subject is bound to leave it as his contribution to the knowledge of the world.::Liberty Hyde Bailey
The true purpose of education is to teach a man to carry himself triumphant to the sunset.::Liberty Hyde Bailey
A person cannot love a plant after he has pruned it, then he has either done a poor job or is devoid of emotion.::Liberty Hyde Bailey
Science may eventually explain the world of How. The ultimate world of Why may remain for contemplation, philosophy, religion.::Liberty Hyde Bailey
A garden requires patient labor and attention. Plants do not grow merely to satisfy ambitions or to fulfill good intentions. They thrive because someone expended effort on them.::Liberty Hyde Bailey
My life has been a continuous fulfillment of dreams. It appears that everything I saw and did has a new, and perhaps, more significant meaning, every time I see it. The earth is good. It is a privilege to live thereon.::Liberty Hyde Bailey
There is no excellence without labor. One cannot dream oneself into either usefulness or happiness.::Liberty Hyde Bailey
One's happiness depends less on what he knows than on what he feels.::Liberty Hyde Bailey
A happy life is one spent in learning, earning, and yearning.::Lillian Gish
What you get is a living, what you give is a life.::Lillian Gish
Middle age is when a guy keeps turning off lights for economical rather than romantic reasons.::Lillian Gordy Carter
It is a mark of many famous people that they cannot part with their brightest hour.::Lillian Hellman
Failure in the theater is more dramatic and uglier than any other form of writing. It costs so much, you feel so guilty.::Lillian Hellman
Things start out as hopes and end up as habits.::Lillian Hellman
Success isn't everything but it makes a man stand straight.::Lillian Hellman
People change and forget to tell each other.::Lillian Hellman
It is not good to see people who have been pretending strength all their lives lose it even for a minute.::Lillian Hellman
Unjust. How many times I've used that word, scolded myself with it. All I mean by it now is that I don't have the final courage to say that I refuse to preside over violations against myself, and to hell with justice.::Lillian Hellman
Nothing you write, if you hope to be good, will ever come out as you first hoped.::Lillian Hellman
I do not regret one moment of my life.::Lillie Langtry
I am happy as happiness goes, for a woman who has so many memories and who lives the lonely life of an actress.::Lillie Langtry
Sympathy is charming, but it does not make up for pain.::Lillie Langtry
They saw me, those reckless seekers of beauty, and in a night I was famous.::Lillie Langtry
Anyone's life truly lived consists of work, sunshine, exercise, soap, plenty of fresh air, and a happy contented spirit.::Lillie Langtry
I am a grandmother now, and that means age is creeping on, creeping on.::Lillie Langtry
If truth is beauty, how come no one has their hair done in the library?::Lily Tomlin

Honesty, integrity, and accountability, the values, which should be the hallmark of this government, have instead been thrown under the bus by an arrogant majority, casualties in a misguided campaign to shield from accountability those who abuse this House.::Louise Slaughter
Electronic music used pure sounds, completely calibrated. You had to think digitally, as it were, in a way that allowed you to extend serial ideas into other parameters through technology.::Luc Ferrari
I think I came across Cecil Taylor a bit later, in 65 or 66. That really impressed me - Cecil Taylor is an amazing character... Both his music and the way he approaches the instrument are astonishing.::Luc Ferrari
One could not have isolated this retrovirus without knowledge of other retroviruses, that's obvious. But I believe we have answered the criteria of isolation.::Luc Montagnier
I am very puzzled by the fact that young people are getting infected again. They don't take precautions despite an enormous amount of information. It's like riding a race car at 200 kilometers an hour. Some people like the risk.::Luc Montagnier
Nobody ever chooses the already unfortunate as objects of his loyal friendship.::Lucan
The gods conceal from men the happiness of death, that they may endure life.::Lucan
We are each of us angels with only one wing, and we can only fly by embracing one another.::Luciano De Crescenzo
Learning music by reading about it is like making love by mail.::Luciano Pavarotti
I want to be famous everywhere.::Luciano Pavarotti
If children are not introduced to music at an early age, I believe something fundamental is actually being taken from them.::Luciano Pavarotti
I was an elementary school teacher.::Luciano Pavarotti
In opera, as with any performing art, to be in great demand and to command high fees you must be good of course, but you must also be famous. The two are different things.::Luciano Pavarotti
He wants only to rest and to have a little peace.::Luciano Pavarotti
It's the continuation of everyone's childhood to see these young children who grow up full of life, full of intelligence, full of a sense of wonder. And within an instant they're gone from this world. It's terrible.::Lucien Bouchard
You see much more of your children once they leave home.::Lucille Ball
How I Love Lucy was born? We decided that instead of divorce lawyers profiting from our mistakes, we'd profit from them.::Lucille Ball
I am a real ham. I love an audience. I work better with an audience. I am dead, in fact, without one.::Lucille Ball
Luck? I don't know anything about luck. I've never banked on it and I'm afraid of people who do. Luck to me is something else: Hard work - and realizing what is opportunity and what isn't.::Lucille Ball
In life, all good things come hard, but wisdom is the hardest to come by.::Lucille Ball
Love yourself first and everything else falls into line. You really have to love yourself to get anything done in this world.::Lucille Ball
I have an everyday religion that works for me. Love yourself first, and everything else falls into line.::Lucille Ball
One of the things I learned the hard way was that it doesn't pay to get discouraged. Keeping busy and making optimism a way of life can restore your faith in yourself.::Lucille Ball
I hate failure and that divorce was a Number One failure in my eyes. It was the worst period of my life. Neither Desi nor I have been the same since, physically or mentally.::Lucille Ball
I will never do another TV series. It couldn't top I Love Lucy, and I'd be foolish to try. In this business, you have to know when to get off.::Lucille Ball
Women's Lib? Oh, I'm afraid it doesn't interest me one bit. I've been so liberated it hurts.::Lucille Ball
I'm not funny. What I am is brave.::Lucille Ball
I'd rather regret the things I've done than regret the things I haven't done.::Lucille Ball
Once in his life, every man is entitled to fall madly in love with a gorgeous redhead.::Lucille Ball
The secret of staying young is to live honestly, eat slowly, and lie about your age.::Lucille Ball
Poetry is a matter of life, not just a matter of language.::Lucille Clifton
People wish to be poets more than they wish to write poetry, and that's a mistake. One should wish to celebrate more than one wishes to be celebrated.::Lucille Clifton
Let them hate so long as they fear.::Lucius Accius
A man whose life has been dishonourable is not entitled to escape disgrace in death.::Lucius Accius
Indeed, wretched the man whose fame makes his misfortunes famous.::Lucius Accius
Learning, while at school, that the charge for the education of girls was the same as that for boys, and that, when they became teachers, women received only half as much as men for their services, the injustice of this distinction was so apparent.::Lucretia Mott
What is food to one man is bitter poison to others.::Lucretius
So potent was religion in persuading to evil deeds.::Lucretius
Such are the heights of wickedness to which men are driven by religion.::Lucretius
If the world's a veil of tears, Smile till rainbows span it.::Lucy Larcom
We should regret our mistakes and learn from them, but never carry them forward into the future with us.::Lucy Maud Montgomery
We must have ideals and try to live up to them, even if we never quite succeed. Life would be a sorry business without them. With them it's grand and great.::Lucy Maud Montgomery
In this world you've just got to hope for the best and prepare for the worst and take whatever God sends.::Lucy Maud Montgomery
But I do believe that a woman's truest place is in a home, with a husband and with children, and with large freedom, pecuniary freedom, personal freedom, and the right to vote.::Lucy Stone
Henceforth the leaves of the tree of knowledge were for women, and for the healing of the nations.::Lucy Stone
From heresy, frenzy and jealousy, good Lord deliver me.::Ludovico Ariosto
A compromise is the art of dividing a cake in such a way that everyone believes he has the biggest piece.::Ludwig Erhard
True education is concerned not only with practical goals but also with values. Our aims assure us of our material life, our values make possible our spiritual life.::Ludwig Mies van der Rohe
Simply by not owning three medium-sized castles in Tuscany I have saved enough money in the last forty years on insurance premiums alone to buy a medium-sized castle in Tuscany.::Ludwig Mies van der Rohe
Architecture is the will of an epoch translated into space.::Ludwig Mies van der Rohe
Less is more.::Ludwig Mies van der Rohe
A chair is a very difficult object. A skyscraper is almost easier. That is why Chippendale is famous.::Ludwig Mies van der Rohe
I don't want to be interesting. I want to be good.::Ludwig Mies van der Rohe
Architecture starts when you carefully put two bricks together. There it begins.::Ludwig Mies van der Rohe
The relationship of the two problems is rather the reverse. To a great extent disarmament is dependent on guarantees of peace. Security comes first and disarmament second.::Ludwig Quidde
The popular, and one may say naive, idea is that peace can be secured by disarmament and that disarmament must therefore precede the attainment of absolute security and lasting peace.::Ludwig Quidde
Every success in limiting armaments is a sign that the will to achieve mutual understanding exists, and every such success thus supports the fight for international law and order.::Ludwig Quidde
A serious and good philosophical work could be written consisting entirely of jokes.::Ludwig Wittgenstein
Knowledge is in the end based on acknowledgement.::Ludwig Wittgenstein
The real discovery is the one which enables me to stop doing philosophy when I want to. The one that gives philosophy peace, so that it is no longer tormented by questions which bring itself into question.::Ludwig Wittgenstein
The human body is the best picture of the human soul.::Ludwig Wittgenstein
It seems to me that, in every culture, I come across a chapter headed 'Wisdom.' And then I know exactly what is going to follow: 'Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.'::Ludwig Wittgenstein
Not every religion has to have St. Augustine's attitude to sex. Why even in our culture marriages are celebrated in a church, everyone present knows what is going to happen that night, but that doesn't prevent it being a religious ceremony.::Ludwig Wittgenstein
Uttering a word is like striking a note on the keyboard of the imagination.::Ludwig Wittgenstein
Humor is not a mood but a way of looking at the world. So if it is correct to say that humor was stamped out in Nazi Germany, that does not mean that people were not in good spirits, or anything of that sort, but something much deeper and more important.::Ludwig Wittgenstein
The logic of the world is prior to all truth and falsehood.::Ludwig Wittgenstein
Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.::Ludwig Wittgenstein
Nowadays it is the fashion to emphasize the horrors of the last war. I didn't find it so horrible. There are just as horrible things happening all round us today, if only we had eyes to see them.::Ludwig Wittgenstein
I sit astride life like a bad rider on a horse. I only owe it to the horse's good nature that I am not thrown off at this very moment.::Ludwig Wittgenstein
Man has to awaken to wonder - and so perhaps do peoples. Science is a way of sending him to sleep again.::Ludwig Wittgenstein
When one is frightened of the truth then it is never the whole truth that one has an inkling of.::Ludwig Wittgenstein
Don't get involved in partial problems, but always take flight to where there is a free view over the whole single great problem, even if this view is still not a clear one.::Ludwig Wittgenstein
It is so characteristic, that just when the mechanics of reproduction are so vastly improved, there are fewer and fewer people who know how the music should be played.::Ludwig Wittgenstein
Death is not an event in life: we do not live to experience death. If we take eternity to mean not infinite temporal duration but timelessness, then eternal life belongs to those who live in the present.::Ludwig Wittgenstein
Recommend virtue to your children it alone, not money, can make them happy. I speak from experience.::Ludwig van Beethoven
Music is the mediator between the spiritual and the sensual life.::Ludwig van Beethoven
Music is the wine which inspires one to new generative processes, and I am Bacchus who presses out this glorious wine for mankind and makes them spiritually drunken.::Ludwig van Beethoven
Recommend to your children virtue that alone can make them happy, not gold.::Ludwig van Beethoven
Music is mediator between spiritual and sensual life.::Ludwig van Beethoven
Art! Who comprehends her? With whom can one consult concerning this great goddess?::Ludwig van Beethoven
Music is the one incorporeal entrance into the higher world of knowledge which comprehends mankind but which mankind cannot comprehend.::Ludwig van Beethoven
Anyone who tells a lie has not a pure heart, and cannot make a good soup.::Ludwig van Beethoven
Beethoven can write music, thank God, but he can do nothing else on earth.::Ludwig van Beethoven
Only the pure in heart can make a good soup.::Ludwig van Beethoven
Music is a higher revelation than all wisdom and philosophy.::Ludwig van Beethoven
Music should strike fire from the heart of man, and bring tears form the eyes of woman.::Ludwig van Beethoven
Off with you! You're a happy fellow, for you'll give happiness and joy to many other people. There is nothing better or greater than that!::Ludwig van Beethoven
Only one thing can conquer war - that attitude of mind which can see nothing in war but destruction and annihilation.::Ludwig von Mises
Society has arisen out of the works of peace the essence of society is peacemaking.::Ludwig von Mises
Peace and not war is the father of all things.::Ludwig von Mises
If history could teach us anything, it would be that private property is inextricably linked with civilization.::Ludwig von Mises
To defeat the aggressors is not enough to make peace durable. The main thing is to discard the ideology that generates war.::Ludwig von Mises
The attainment of the economic aims of man presupposes peace.::Ludwig von Mises
Modern society, based as it is on the division of labor, can be preserved only under conditions of lasting peace.::Ludwig von Mises
Whoever wants peace among nations must seek to limit the state and its influence most strictly.::Ludwig von Mises
Whoever wishes peace among peoples must fight statism.::Ludwig von Mises
If some peoples pretend that history or geography gives them the right to subjugate other races, nations, or peoples, there can be no peace.::Ludwig von Mises
Logic is one thing, the human animal another. You can quite easily propose a logical solution to something and at the same time hope in your heart of hearts it won't work out.::Luigi Pirandello
Nature uses human imagination to lift her work of creation to even higher levels.::Luigi Pirandello
The history of mankind is the history of ideas.::Luigi Pirandello
I would love to spend all my time writing to you I'd love to share with you all that goes through my mind, all that weighs on my heart, all that gives air to my soul phantoms of art, dreams that would be so beautiful if they could come true.::Luigi Pirandello
I present myself to you in a form suitable to the relationship I wish to achieve with you.::Luigi Pirandello
That is why the analogy of stealing does not work. With a thief, we want to know how much money he stole, and from whom. With the artist it is not how much he took and from whom, but what he did with it.::Lukas Foss
I don't dare postulate about science, but I know that it takes both emotion and intellect in order for art to happen.::Lukas Foss
I have as much input to the blues I just never got the chance, the opportunity or maybe the respect.::Luther Allison
I think I'm the most positive guy still going in my generation, and I'm out there to prove that.::Luther Allison
We must return to nature and nature's god.::Luther Burbank
If you violate Nature's laws you are your own prosecuting attorney, judge, jury, and hangman.::Luther Burbank
The secret of improved plant breeding, apart from scientific knowledge, is love.::Luther Burbank
It is well for people who think to change their minds occasionally in order to keep them clean. For those who do not think, it is best at least to rearrange their prejudices once in a while.::Luther Burbank
Flowers always make people better, happier, and more helpful they are sunshine, food and medicine for the soul.::Luther Burbank
If we had paid no more attention to our plants than we have to our children, we would now be living in a jungle of weed.::Luther Burbank
Science is knowledge arranged and classified according to truth, facts, and the general laws of nature.::Luther Burbank
I see humanity now as one vast plant, needing for its highest fulfillment only love, the natural blessings of the great outdoors, and intelligent crossing and selection.::Luther Burbank
The strength of a nation, especially of a republican nation, is in the intelligent and well ordered homes of the people.::Lydia Sigourney
Patience is passion tamed.::Lyman Abbott
The bill neither confers nor abridges the rights of anyone but simply declares that in civil rights there shall be equality among all classes of citizens and that all alike shall be subject to the same punishment.::Lyman Trumbull
One of the things that bothers me most is the growing belief in the country that security is more important than freedom. It ain't.::Lyn Nofziger
The reason this country continues its drift toward socialism and big nanny government is because too many people vote in the expectation of getting something for nothing, not because they have a concern for what is good for the country.::Lyn Nofziger
The tree of liberty needs to be watered from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.::Lyn Nofziger
I sometimes lie awake at night trying to think of something funny that Richard Nixon said.::Lyn Nofziger
I think the American people have become more reliant upon government and less reliant upon themselves and that they now tend to put security ahead of freedom, but I think freedom is the most important aspect of our lives.::Lyn Nofziger
The guns and the bombs, the rockets and the warships, are all symbols of human failure.::Lyndon B. Johnson
Education is not a problem. Education is an opportunity.::Lyndon B. Johnson
Peace is a journey of a thousand miles and it must be taken one step at a time.::Lyndon B. Johnson
If future generations are to remember us more with gratitude than sorrow, we must achieve more than just the miracles of technology. We must also leave them a glimpse of the world as it was created, not just as it looked when we got through with it.::Lyndon B. Johnson
Until justice is blind to color, until education is unaware of race, until opportunity is unconcerned with the color of men's skins, emancipation will be a proclamation but not a fact.::Lyndon B. Johnson
We have entered an age in which education is not just a luxury permitting some men an advantage over others. It has become a necessity without which a person is defenseless in this complex, industrialized society. We have truly entered the century of the educated man.::Lyndon B. Johnson
This administration here and now declares unconditional war on poverty.::Lyndon B. Johnson
If one morning I walked on top of the water across the Potomac River, the headline that afternoon would read: 'President Can't Swim.'::Lyndon B. Johnson
Freedom is not enough.::Lyndon B. Johnson
I have learned that only two things are necessary to keep one's wife happy. First, let her think she's having her own way. And second, let her have it.::Lyndon B. Johnson
One lesson you better learn if you want to be in politics is that you never go out on a golf course and beat the President.::Lyndon B. Johnson
Our purpose in Vietnam is to prevent the success of aggression. It is not conquest, it is not empire, it is not foreign bases, it is not domination. It is, simply put, just to prevent the forceful conquest of South Vietnam by North Vietnam.::Lyndon B. Johnson
I'm tired. I'm tired of feeling rejected by the American people. I'm tired of waking up in the middle of the night worrying about the war.::Lyndon B. Johnson
I'd rather give my life than be afraid to give it.::Lyndon B. Johnson
Our most tragic error may have been our inability to establish a rapport and a confidence with the press and television with the communication media. I don't think the press has understood me.::Lyndon B. Johnson
Our society is illuminated by the spiritual insights of the Hebrew prophets. America and Israel have a common love of human freedom, and they have a common faith in a democratic way of life.::Lyndon B. Johnson
The separation of church and state is a source of strength, but the conscience of our nation does not call for separation between men of state and faith in the Supreme Being.::Lyndon B. Johnson
The CIA is made up of boys whose families sent them to Princeton but wouldn't let them into the family brokerage business.::Lyndon B. Johnson
I believe we can continue the Great Society while we fight in Vietnam.::Lyndon B. Johnson
I am concerned about the whole man. I am concerned about what the people, using their government as an instrument and a tool, can do toward building the whole man, which will mean a better society and a better world.::Lyndon B. Johnson
Presidents quickly realize that while a single act might destroy the world they live in, no one single decision can make life suddenly better or can turn history around for the good.::Lyndon B. Johnson
The fifth freedom is freedom from ignorance.::Lyndon B. Johnson
I want to make a policy statement. I am unabashedly in favor of women.::Lyndon B. Johnson
This is not Johnson's war. This is America's war. If I drop dead tomorrow, this war will still be with you.::Lyndon B. Johnson
What we won when all of our people united must not be lost in suspicion and distrust and selfishness and politics. Accordingly, I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as president.::Lyndon B. Johnson
You aren't learning anything when you're talking.::Lyndon B. Johnson
There is but one way for a president to deal with Congress, and that is continuously, incessantly, and without interruption. If it is really going to work, the relationship has got to be almost incestuous.::Lyndon B. Johnson
I report to you that our country is challenged at home and abroad: that it is our will that is being tried and not our strength our sense of purpose and not our ability to achieve a better America.::Lyndon B. Johnson
Being president is like being a jackass in a hailstorm. There's nothing to do but to stand there and take it.::Lyndon B. Johnson
We have the opportunity to move not only toward the rich society and the powerful society, but upward to the Great Society.::Lyndon B. Johnson
Poverty must not be a bar to learning and learning must offer an escape from poverty.::Lyndon B. Johnson
I will do my best. That is all I can do. I ask for your help - and God's.::Lyndon B. Johnson
I seldom think of politics more than eighteen hours a day.::Lyndon B. Johnson
We are not about to send American boys 9 or 10 thousand miles away from home to do what Asian boys ought to be doing for themselves.::Lyndon B. Johnson
The vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by man for breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible walls which imprison men because they are different from other men.::Lyndon B. Johnson
The Russians feared Ike. They didn't fear me.::Lyndon B. Johnson
To conclude that women are unfitted to the task of our historic society seems to me the equivalent of closing male eyes to female facts.::Lyndon B. Johnson
In our home there was always prayer - aloud, proud and unapologetic.::Lyndon B. Johnson
The men who have guided the destiny of the United States have found the strength for their tasks by going to their knees. This private unity of public men and their God is an enduring source of reassurance for the people of America.::Lyndon B. Johnson
Of course, the plea for respect for nonhuman life goes far beyond the scientific delight of familiarity with our planet mates. The nonhuman forms of life with which we 6,000 million talking, upright apes share this finite planet are directly or indirectly connected to our well-being.::Lynn Margulis
All living beings, not just animals, but plants and microorganisms, perceive. To survive, an organic being must perceive - it must seek, or at least recognize, food and avoid environmental danger.::Lynn Margulis
There is no scientific reason to think that we, even with space travel, are going to survive as a species for ever, certainly not by biting off the hand that feeds us, which is exactly what we are doing.::Lynn Margulis
Despite our very recent appearance on the planet, humanity combines arrogance with increasing material demands, even as we become more numerous. Our toughness is a delusion. Have we the intelligence and discipline to vigilantly guard against our tendency to grow without limit?::Lynn Margulis
The only security men can have for their political liberty, consists in keeping their money in their own pockets.::Lysander Spooner
But whether the Constitution really be one thing, or another, this much is certain - that it has either authorized such a government as we have had, or has been powerless to prevent it. In either case, it is unfit to exist.::Lysander Spooner
That no government, so called, can reasonably be trusted, or reasonably be supposed to have honest purposes in view, any longer than it depends wholly upon voluntary support.::Lysander Spooner
If the jury have no right to judge of the justice of a law of the government, they plainly can do nothing to protect the people against the oppressions of the government for there are no oppressions which the government may not authorize by law.::Lysander Spooner
The stability and peace which seemed to be so firmly established by the brilliant monarchy of Francis I vanished with the terrible outbreak of the Wars of Religion.::Lytton Strachey
The old interests of aristocracy - the romance of action, the exalted passions of chivalry and war - faded into the background, and their place was taken by the refined and intimate pursuits of peace and civilization.::Lytton Strachey
My work is a game, a very serious game.::M. C. Escher
I don't use drugs, my dreams are frightening enough.::M. C. Escher
Sharing food with another human being is an intimate act that should not be indulged in lightly.::M. F. K. Fisher
Wine and cheese are ageless companions, like aspirin and aches, or June and moon, or good people and noble ventures.::M. F. K. Fisher
When I was a graduate student, the leading spirits at Harvard were interested in the history of ideas.::M. H. Abrams
It's amazing how, age after age, in country after country, and in all languages, Shakespeare emerges as incomparable.::M. H. Abrams
If you read quickly to get through a poem to what it means, you have missed the body of the poem.::M. H. Abrams
It may not always be easy, convenient, or politically correct to stand for truth and right, but it is the right thing to do. Always.::M. Russell Ballard
Whenever we seek to avoid the responsibility for our own behavior, we do so by attempting to give that responsibility to some other individual or organization or entity. But this means we then give away our power to that entity.::M. Scott Peck
The whole course of human history may depend on a change of heart in one solitary and even humble individual - for it is in the solitary mind and soul of the individual that the battle between good and evil is waged and ultimately won or lost.::M. Scott Peck
Real love is a permanently self-enlarging experience.::M. Scott Peck
We know a great deal more about the causes of physical disease than we do about the causes of physical health.::M. Scott Peck
Discipline is wisdom and vice versa.::M. Scott Peck
The great awareness comes slowly, piece by piece. The path of spiritual growth is a path of lifelong learning. The experience of spiritual power is basically a joyful one.::M. Scott Peck
There can be no vulnerability without risk there can be no community without vulnerability there can be no peace, and ultimately no life, without community.::M. Scott Peck
Ultimately love is everything.::M. Scott Peck
Until you value yourself, you won't value your time. Until you value your time, you will not do anything with it.::M. Scott Peck
The relationships that people have - that are sexual, psychological, emotional - these relationships are not open to supervision by parents, schools, churches, or government. Nobody has any right to intervene at all in any kind of relationship like that.::Madalyn Murray O'Hair
An Atheist believes that a hospital should be built instead of a church. An atheist believes that deed must be done instead of prayer said. An atheist strives for involvement in life and not escape into death. He wants disease conquered, poverty vanished, war eliminated.::Madalyn Murray O'Hair
Religion is induced insanity.::Madalyn Murray O'Hair
Religion has caused more misery to all of mankind in every stage of human history than any other single idea.::Madalyn Murray O'Hair
I hope I'm wrong, but I am afraid that Iraq is going to turn out to be the greatest disaster in American foreign policy - worse than Vietnam, not in the number who died, but in terms of its unintended consequences and its reverberation throughout the region.::Madeleine Albright
As strong as the United States is, we can't deal with terrorism alone.::Madeleine Albright
I really think that there was a great advantage in many ways to being a woman. I think we are a lot better at personal relationships, and then have the capability obviously of telling it like it is when it's necessary.::Madeleine Albright
Most of the time I spend when I get up in the morning is trying to figure out what is going to happen.::Madeleine Albright
Jewelry and pins have been worn throughout history as symbols of power, sending messages. Interestingly enough, it was mostly men who wore the jewelry in various times, and obviously crowns were part of signals that were being sent throughout history by people of rank.::Madeleine Albright
I saw what happened when a dictator was allowed to take over a piece of a country and the country went down the tubes. And I saw the opposite during the war when America joined the fight.::Madeleine Albright
I am often asked if, when I was secretary, I had problems with foreign men. That is not who I had problems with, because I arrived in a very large plane that said United States of America. I had more problems with the men in our own government.::Madeleine Albright
I was a little girl in World War II and I'm used to being freed by Americans.::Madeleine Albright
No matter what message you are about to deliver somewhere, whether it is holding out a hand of friendship, or making clear that you disapprove of something, is the fact that the person sitting across the table is a human being, so the goal is to always establish common ground.::Madeleine Albright
I love being a woman and I was not one of these women who rose through professional life by wearing men's clothes or looking masculine. I loved wearing bright colors and being who I am.::Madeleine Albright
The U.N. bureaucracy has grown to elephantine proportions. Now that the Cold War is over, we are asking that elephant to do gymnastics.::Madeleine Albright
I can't imagine what it is like to be raised in a society where their only statues that exist are to you and your father.::Madeleine Albright
Maybe if everybody in leadership was a woman, you might not get into the conflicts in the first place. But if you watch the women who have made it to the top, they haven't exactly been non-aggressive - including me.::Madeleine Albright
If we have to use force, it is because we are America. We are the indispensable nation. We stand tall. We see further into the future.::Madeleine Albright
I did go to Wellesley, a women's college. And I am of a kind of strange generation which is transitional in terms of women who wanted to go out and get jobs.::Madeleine Albright
Women have to be active listeners and interrupters - but when you interrupt, you have to know what you are talking about.::Madeleine Albright
We live in an image society. Speeches are not what anybody cares about what they care about is the picture.::Madeleine Albright
Women can't do everything at the same time, we need to understand milestones in our lives comes in segments.::Madeleine Albright
I didn't want to set up a women's studies program. I thought women should learn to operate in a coeducational atmosphere, because, especially in national security and international affairs, it's male-dominated.::Madeleine Albright
I know that war is very cruel and that life is harder when you aren't able to live in the place you called home.::Madeleine Albright
While democracy in the long run is the most stable form of government, in the short run, it is among the most fragile.::Madeleine Albright
I wasn't a normal professor. I had worked in government. I hadn't written nine zillion books. I was a hands-on professor.::Madeleine Albright
I have said this many times, that there seems to be enough room in the world for mediocre men, but not for mediocre women, and we really have to work very, very hard.::Madeleine Albright
The best book, like the best speech, will do it all - make us laugh, think, cry and cheer - preferably in that order.::Madeleine Albright
I think women are really good at making friends and not good at networking. Men are good at networking and not necessarily making friends. That's a gross generalization, but I think it holds in many ways.::Madeleine Albright
Well I do think, when there are more women, that the tone of the conversation changes, and also the goals of the conversation change. But it doesn't mean that the whole world would be a lot better if it were totally run by women. If you think that, you've forgotten high school.::Madeleine Albright
I think that we had a different view of what the 21st century could be like, with much more of a sense, from our perspective, of trying to have an interdependent world: looking at solving regional conflicts, having strength in alliances, operating within some kind of a sense that we were part of the international community and not outside of it.::Madeleine Albright
Hussein has chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies.::Madeleine Albright
Because of my parents' love of democracy, we came to America after being driven twice from our home in Czechoslovakia - first by Hitler and then by Stalin.::Madeleine Albright
If you look at U.S. history through religious history, there is very much a motif that shows the importance religion has played in the U.S. We're a very religious country and it affects the way we look at various political issues.::Madeleine Albright
This is pure speculation, but for a period of time, a lot of getting into a party was through fundraising and volunteer work, and Republican women had more time to do that than democratic women, who were out there getting jobs.::Madeleine Albright
But I do not believe that the world would be entirely different if there were more women leaders. Maybe if everybody in leadership was a woman, you might not get into the conflicts in the first place. But if you watch the women who have made it to the top, they haven't exactly been non-aggressive - including me.::Madeleine Albright
It's one thing to be religious, but it's another thing to make religion your policy.::Madeleine Albright
I think the personal relationships I established mattered in terms of what I was able to get done. And I did bring women's issues to the center of our foreign policy.::Madeleine Albright
Really, I have to laugh because there was a whole set of stories that made me sound like the Dragon Lady, you know, 'tough this and tough that.' Then there is this business about 'gooey.' The bottom line is I am a pragmatic idealist.::Madeleine Albright
The magic of America is that we're a free and open society with a mixed population. Part of our security is our freedom.::Madeleine Albright
We will not be intimidated or pushed off the world stage by people who do not like what we stand for, and that is, freedom, democracy and the fight against disease, poverty and terrorism.::Madeleine Albright
I am a beneficiary of the American people's generosity, and I hope we can have comprehensive immigration legislation that allows this country to continue to be enriched by those who were not born here.::Madeleine Albright
I think women want to take care of themselves, and I think having a voice in how that is done is very important.::Madeleine Albright
The great thing about getting older is that you don't lose all the other ages you've been.::Madeleine L'Engle
Because you're not what I would have you be, I blind myself to who, in truth, you are.::Madeleine L'Engle
When the bright angel dominates, out comes a great work of art, a Michelangelo David or a Beethoven symphony.::Madeleine L'Engle
I like the fact that in ancient Chinese art the great painters always included a deliberate flaw in their work: human creation is never perfect.::Madeleine L'Engle

Stand before the people you fear and speak your mind - even if your voice shakes.::Maggie Kuhn
I had been feeling a little rum. I didn't think it was anything serious because years ago I felt a lump and it was benign. I assumed this would be too. It kind of takes the wind out of your sails, and I don't know what the future holds, if anything.::Maggie Smith
I tend to head for what's amusing because a lot of things aren't happy. But usually you can find a funny side to practically anything.::Maggie Smith
It seems to me there is a change in what audiences want to see. I can only hope that's correct, because there's an awful lot of people of my age around now and we outnumber the others.::Maggie Smith
They thought I was a success as soon as I started paying the bills.::Mahalia Jackson

Even if you are a minority of one, the truth is the truth.::Mahatma Gandhi

What do I think of Western civilization? I think it would be a very good idea.::Mahatma Gandhi
Man falls from the pursuit of the ideal of plan living and high thinking the moment he wants to multiply his daily wants. Man's happiness really lies in contentment.::Mahatma Gandhi
I will far rather see the race of man extinct than that we should become less than beasts by making the noblest of God's creation, woman, the object of our lust.::Mahatma Gandhi
You must be the change you wish to see in the world.::Mahatma Gandhi
As human beings, our greatness lies not so much in being able to remake the world - that is the myth of the atomic age - as in being able to remake ourselves.::Mahatma Gandhi
Anger is the enemy of non-violence and pride is a monster that swallows it up.::Mahatma Gandhi

Violent men have not been known in history to die to a man. They die up to a point.::Mahatma Gandhi
The spirit of democracy is not a mechanical thing to be adjusted by abolition of forms. It requires change of heart.::Mahatma Gandhi
Where there is love there is life.::Mahatma Gandhi
Man can never be a woman's equal in the spirit of selfless service with which nature has endowed her.::Mahatma Gandhi
I object to violence because when it appears to do good, the good is only temporary the evil it does is permanent.::Mahatma Gandhi
There is more to life than increasing its speed.::Mahatma Gandhi
It is health that is real wealth and not pieces of gold and silver.::Mahatma Gandhi
I believe in equality for everyone, except reporters and photographers.::Mahatma Gandhi
Man becomes great exactly in the degree in which he works for the welfare of his fellow-men.::Mahatma Gandhi
I do all the evil I can before I learn to shun it? Is it not enough to know the evil to shun it? If not, we should be sincere enough to admit that we love evil too well to give it up.::Mahatma Gandhi
Violent means will give violent freedom. That would be a menace to the world and to India herself.::Mahatma Gandhi
Before the throne of the Almighty, man will be judged not by his acts but by his intentions. For God alone reads our hearts.::Mahatma Gandhi
Faith... must be enforced by reason... when faith becomes blind it dies.::Mahatma Gandhi
I believe in the fundamental truth of all great religions of the world.::Mahatma Gandhi
Peace is its own reward.::Mahatma Gandhi
The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.::Mahatma Gandhi

Those who know how to think need no teachers.::Mahatma Gandhi

If patience is worth anything, it must endure to the end of time. And a living faith will last in the midst of the blackest storm.::Mahatma Gandhi
Truth is by nature self-evident. As soon as you remove the cobwebs of ignorance that surround it, it shines clear.::Mahatma Gandhi
Justice that love gives is a surrender, justice that law gives is a punishment.::Mahatma Gandhi
Spiritual relationship is far more precious than physical. Physical relationship divorced from spiritual is body without soul.::Mahatma Gandhi
Let us all be brave enough to die the death of a martyr, but let no one lust for martyrdom.::Mahatma Gandhi
Are creeds such simple things like the clothes which a man can change at will and put on at will? Creeds are such for which people live for ages and ages.::Mahatma Gandhi
Truth stands, even if there be no public support. It is self-sustained.::Mahatma Gandhi
An error does not become truth by reason of multiplied propagation, nor does truth become error because nobody sees it.::Mahatma Gandhi
Freedom is never dear at any price. It is the breath of life. What would a man not pay for living?::Mahatma Gandhi
We should meet abuse by forbearance. Human nature is so constituted that if we take absolutely no notice of anger or abuse, the person indulging in it will soon weary of it and stop.::Mahatma Gandhi
One's own religion is after all a matter between oneself and one's Maker and no one else's.::Mahatma Gandhi
To deprive a man of his natural liberty and to deny to him the ordinary amenities of life is worse then starving the body it is starvation of the soul, the dweller in the body.::Mahatma Gandhi

A man who was completely innocent, offered himself as a sacrifice for the good of others, including his enemies, and became the ransom of the world. It was a perfect act.::Mahatma Gandhi
Man's nature is not essentially evil. Brute nature has been know to yield to the influence of love. You must never despair of human nature.::Mahatma Gandhi
Each one prays to God according to his own light.::Mahatma Gandhi
It is better to be violent, if there is violence in our hearts, than to put on the cloak of nonviolence to cover impotence.::Mahatma Gandhi
Power is of two kinds. One is obtained by the fear of punishment and the other by acts of love. Power based on love is a thousand times more effective and permanent then the one derived from fear of punishment.::Mahatma Gandhi
Gentleness, self-sacrifice and generosity are the exclusive possession of no one race or religion.::Mahatma Gandhi
God is, even though the whole world deny him. Truth stands, even if there be no public support. It is self-sustained.::Mahatma Gandhi
I know, to banish anger altogether from one's breast is a difficult task. It cannot be achieved through pure personal effort. It can be done only by God's grace.::Mahatma Gandhi
Every formula of every religion has in this age of reason, to submit to the acid test of reason and universal assent.::Mahatma Gandhi
The good man is the friend of all living things.::Mahatma Gandhi
It is easy enough to be friendly to one's friends. But to befriend the one who regards himself as your enemy is the quintessence of true religion. The other is mere business.::Mahatma Gandhi
There is no principle worth the name if it is not wholly good.::Mahatma Gandhi
Among the many misdeeds of the British rule in India, history will look upon the act depriving a whole nation of arms as the blackest.::Mahatma Gandhi
When restraint and courtesy are added to strength, the latter becomes irresistible.::Mahatma Gandhi
Only he can take great resolves who has indomitable faith in God and has fear of God.::Mahatma Gandhi
It has always been a mystery to me how men can feel themselves honoured by the humiliation of their fellow beings.::Mahatma Gandhi
God, as Truth, has been for me a treasure beyond price. May He be so to every one of us.::Mahatma Gandhi
It is unwise to be too sure of one's own wisdom. It is healthy to be reminded that the strongest might weaken and the wisest might err.::Mahatma Gandhi
I have nothing new to teach the world. Truth and Non-violence are as old as the hills. All I have done is to try experiments in both on as vast a scale as I could.::Mahatma Gandhi
Non-violence is the article of faith.::Mahatma Gandhi
There is nothing that wastes the body like worry, and one who has any faith in God should be ashamed to worry about anything whatsoever.::Mahatma Gandhi

Is it not enough to know the evil to shun it? If not, we should be sincere enough to admit that we love evil too well to give it up.::Mahatma Gandhi
But for my faith in God, I should have been a raving maniac.::Mahatma Gandhi
My life is my message.::Mahatma Gandhi
Man should forget his anger before he lies down to sleep.::Mahatma Gandhi
What is true of the individual will be tomorrow true of the whole nation if individuals will but refuse to lose heart and hope.::Mahatma Gandhi

Faith is not something to grasp, it is a state to grow into.::Mahatma Gandhi
Infinite striving to be the best is man's duty it is its own reward. Everything else is in God's hands.::Mahatma Gandhi
Just as a man would not cherish living in a body other than his own, so do nations not like to live under other nations, however noble and great the latter may be.::Mahatma Gandhi
Constant development is the law of life, and a man who always tries to maintain his dogmas in order to appear consistent drives himself into a false position.::Mahatma Gandhi
Prayer is the key of the morning and the bolt of the evening.::Mahatma Gandhi
Freedom is not worth having if it does not connote freedom to err.::Mahatma Gandhi
It is the quality of our work which will please God and not the quantity.::Mahatma Gandhi
The main purpose of life is to live rightly, think rightly, act rightly. The soul must languish when we give all our thought to the body.::Mahatma Gandhi
Those who say religion has nothing to do with politics do not know what religion is.::Mahatma Gandhi
All the religions of the world, while they may differ in other respects, unitedly proclaim that nothing lives in this world but Truth.::Mahatma Gandhi
Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.::Mahatma Gandhi

We need international support so that our people live a life of normality, of dignity, of liberty and freedom. I hope that our cry for freedom may be heard.::Mahmoud Abbas
If a person studies too much and exhausts his reflective powers, he will be confused, and will not be able to apprehend even that which had been within the power of his apprehension. For the powers of the body are all alike in this respect.::Maimonides
He, however, who begins with Metaphysics, will not only become confused in matters of religion, but will fall into complete infidelity.::Maimonides
Now, we occupy a lowly position, both in space and rank in comparison with the heavenly sphere, and the Almighty is Most High not in space, but with respect to absolute existence, greatness and power.::Maimonides
You must accept the truth from whatever source it comes.::Maimonides
You will certainly not doubt the necessity of studying astronomy and physics, if you are desirous of comprehending the relation between the world and Providence as it is in reality, and not according to imagination.::Maimonides
No disease that can be treated by diet should be treated with any other means.::Maimonides
Do not imagine that what we have said of the insufficiency of our understanding and of its limited extent is an assertion founded only on the Bible: for philosophers likewise assert the same, and perfectly understand it,- without having regard to any religion or opinion.::Maimonides
But he knew people and he was head writer for Have Gun Will Travel, and if you took those early Star Treks that we did and put us in a western wardrobe and put us on wagon train going west, we can say the same lines.::Majel Barrett
You go through at least the first two years of Star Trek and you find some amazing stuff. Everything that was going on Gene put into the series. He just put strange costumes on the actors and painted them funny colours and left the same situation in.::Majel Barrett
We can not wait until we have enough trained people willing to work at a teacher's salary and under conditions imposed upon teachers in order to improve what happens in the classroom.::Major Owens
We can do it better, more consistently, and in the end, it will cost us less because the students that we produce will be superior to those without technology experience.::Major Owens
I have a great deal of respect and admiration for people who put themselves on the line.::Major Owens
Therefore, you are not training young people for the world of today and the world of tomorrow unless you are doing proven technology training. That is one of the reasons I'm so concerned.::Major Owens
You have no power at all if you do not exercise constant power.::Major Owens
I would like to spend my next two years showing how the aim of making technology available to every young person can be built into the effort to make our nation more secure. That is my latest concern and what I will be pushing over the next two years.::Major Owens
I will continue my activities related to education in one way or another. I certainly would have at the top my agenda, with respect to education, the need to do much better with modern educational technology.::Major Owens
I do not think we are ever going to be able to, for a long time, get the kind of quality of school personnel that we need in our schools, especially in the areas of science and math. One of the answers to that problem is to use more educational technology.::Major Owens
Technology tools such as laptops are the kind of help that we need. A program that provides laptops for all youngsters would close a gap that most of us are not aware of, or will not admit to, which is a tremendous gap in the poor communities.::Major Owens
Excitement in education and student productivity, the ability to get a result that you want from students, go together and cannot be separated.::Major Owens
Education technology is very important because we have a massive challenge in public schools.::Major Owens
Education technology and school construction go together. Modernization, updating education facilities, and making a capital investment in education are all included.::Major Owens
The problem was just a mean attitude that festers and has to be challenged.::Major Owens
We can close the gap and improve what happens in the classroom by using educational technology that is the same high quality everywhere.::Major Owens
Children are already accustomed to a world that moves faster and is more exciting than anything a teacher in front of a classroom can do.::Major Owens
The ownership of computers in the home is far less than the statistics show, because usually when the computer breaks down once, that is the end of it for a long, long time. They do not have the money or incentive to get the computer repaired.::Major Owens
The moral turpitude of the boys of today appears to center in their failure to concentrate on any particular objective long enough to obtain their maximum results.::Major Taylor
I can hardly express in words my deep feeling and sympathy for them, knowing as I do, the many serious handicaps and obstacles that will confront them in almost every walk of life.::Major Taylor
These rules may seem simple enough, but it will require great morale and physical courage to adhere to them. But if carried out in the strict sense of the word it will surely lead to a greater success than could otherwise be attained.::Major Taylor
In closing I wish to say that while I was sorely beset by a number of white riders in my racing days, I have also enjoyed the friendship of countless thousands of white men whom I class as among my closest friends.::Major Taylor
Modesty should be typical of the success of a champion.::Major Taylor
I pray they will carry on in spite of that dreadful monster prejudice, and with patience, courage, fortitude and perseverance achieve success for themselves.::Major Taylor
Music is the social act of communication among people, a gesture of friendship, the strongest there is.::Malcolm Arnold
I have glaucoma, so use eye drops both morning and night.::Malcolm Boyd
I find Jesus my confidant and companion, brother and savior our relationship is intimate, vulnerable, demanding yet comfortable and reassuring.::Malcolm Boyd

The purpose of education is to replace an empty mind with an open one.::Malcolm Forbes
Success follows doing what you want to do. There is no other way to be successful.::Malcolm Forbes
When things are bad, we take comfort in the thought that they could always get worse. And when they are, we find hope in the thought that things are so bad they have to get better.::Malcolm Forbes
Few businessmen are capable of being in politics, they don't understand the democratic process, they have neither the tolerance or the depth it takes. Democracy isn't a business.::Malcolm Forbes
Three years ago the Government announced the creation of Reconciliation Place, and said that it would include a memorial to those removed from their families. However, they refused to include any of those who were removed in the design of their own memorial.::Malcolm Fraser
Over 120 Aboriginal communities run their own health services - some have been doing so for 30 years. They struggle with difficult medical problems. They also try to deal with counselling, stolen generations issues, family relationships, violence, suicide prevention.::Malcolm Fraser
Reconciliation requires changes of heart and spirit, as well as social and economic change. It requires symbolic as well as practical action.::Malcolm Fraser
Health economists have estimated that an injection of $250 million per year in Indigenous clinical care, and $50 million in preventative care, is required to provide services at the same level as for any other group with the health conditions of Indigenous Australians.::Malcolm Fraser
Sex is the mysticism of materialism and the only possible religion in a materialistic society.::Malcolm Muggeridge
One of the many pleasures of old age is giving things up.::Malcolm Muggeridge
Bad humor is an evasion of reality good humor is an acceptance of it.::Malcolm Muggeridge
Travel, of course, narrows the mind.::Malcolm Muggeridge
My opinion, my conviction, gains immensely in strength and sureness the minute a second mind as adopted it.::Malcolm Muggeridge
There is no such thing as darkness only a failure to see.::Malcolm Muggeridge
Sex is the ersatz or substitute religion of the 20th Century.::Malcolm Muggeridge
One of the peculiar sins of the twentieth century which we've developed to a very high level is the sin of credulity. It has been said that when human beings stop believing in God they believe in nothing. The truth is much worse: they believe in anything.::Malcolm Muggeridge
History will see advertising as one of the real evil things of our time. It is stimulating people constantly to want things, want this, want that.::Malcolm Muggeridge
The pursuit of happiness, which American citizens are obliged to undertake, tends to involve them in trying to perpetuate the moods, tastes and aptitudes of youth.::Malcolm Muggeridge
Every happening, great and small, is a parable whereby God speaks to us, and the art of life is to get the message.::Malcolm Muggeridge
I can say that I never knew what joy was like until I gave up pursuing happiness, or cared to live until I chose to die. For these two discoveries I am beholden to Jesus.::Malcolm Muggeridge
Doctrines provide an architecture for both Republican and Democrat presidents to carry out policies.::Malcolm Wallop
You don't have to be a man to fight for freedom. All you have to do is to be an intelligent human being.::Malcolm X
You can't separate peace from freedom because no one can be at peace unless he has his freedom.::Malcolm X
Power in defense of freedom is greater than power in behalf of tyranny and oppression.::Malcolm X
I'm for truth, no matter who tells it. I'm for justice, no matter who it's for or against.::Malcolm X
I have more respect for a man who lets me know where he stands, even if he's wrong. Than the one who comes up like an angel and is nothing but a devil.::Malcolm X
If you're not ready to die for it, put the word 'freedom' out of your vocabulary.::Malcolm X
You're not supposed to be so blind with patriotism that you can't face reality. Wrong is wrong, no matter who says it.::Malcolm X
The Negro revolution is controlled by foxy white liberals, by the Government itself. But the Black Revolution is controlled only by God.::Malcolm X
Nobody can give you freedom. Nobody can give you equality or justice or anything. If you're a man, you take it.::Malcolm X
Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today.::Malcolm X
You can't legislate good will - that comes through education.::Malcolm X
The future belongs to those who prepare for it today.::Malcolm X
My Alma mater was books, a good library... I could spend the rest of my life reading, just satisfying my curiosity.::Malcolm X
Truth is on the side of the oppressed.::Malcolm X
In all our deeds, the proper value and respect for time determines success or failure.::Malcolm X
There is no better than adversity. Every defeat, every heartbreak, every loss, contains its own seed, its own lesson on how to improve your performance the next time.::Malcolm X
If you have no critics you'll likely have no success.::Malcolm X
Without education, you are not going anywhere in this world.::Malcolm X
Be peaceful, be courteous, obey the law, respect everyone but if someone puts his hand on you, send him to the cemetery.::Malcolm X
I don't even call it violence when it's in self defense I call it intelligence.::Malcolm X
I believe in a religion that believes in freedom. Any time I have to accept a religion that won't let me fight a battle for my people, I say to hell with that religion.::Malcolm X
Power never takes a back step only in the face of more power.::Malcolm X
It has never been my object to record my dreams, just the determination to realize them.::Man Ray
I paint what cannot be photographed, that which comes from the imagination or from dreams, or from an unconscious drive.::Man Ray
I never was good at learning things. I did just enough work to pass. In my opinion it would have been wrong to do more than was just sufficient, so I worked as little as possible.::Manfred von Richthofen
In the heat of the Russian summer a sleeping car is the most horrible instrument of martyrdom imaginable.::Manfred von Richthofen
Clearly you need a new team to go out to bat on your behalf to fight for your rights and to report back to you personally and to the leadership of the IFP.::Mangosuthu Buthelezi
We have our own history, our own language, our own culture. But our destiny is also tied up with the destinies of other people - history has made us all South Africans.::Mangosuthu Buthelezi
My top most priority is to deal with India's massive social and economic problems, so that chronic poverty, ignorance and disease can be conquered in a reasonably short period of time.::Manmohan Singh
We should try to understand our innermost needs. We shouldn't use irony to reduce their power.::Manuel Puig
It doesn't matter that the way of life shown by Hollywood was phony. It helped you hope.::Manuel Puig
I've never seen a worse situation than that of young writers in the United States. The publishing business in North America is so commercialized.::Manuel Puig
I don't think humor is forced upon my universe it's a part of it.::Manuel Puig
I think cinema is closer to allegories than to reality. It's closer to our dreams.::Manuel Puig
I am very interested in what has been called bad taste. I believe the fear of displaying a soi-disant bad taste stops us from venturing into special cultural zones.::Manuel Puig
I'm not terribly happy about rock and roll. Certain rock music is uninspiring, numbing it makes you feel like an idiot.::Manuel Puig
If it's great stuff, the people who consume it are nourished. It's a positive force.::Manuel Puig
What better model of a synthesis than a nocturnal dream? Dreams simplify, don't they?::Manuel Puig
For someone who writes fiction, in order to activate the imagination and the unconscious, it's essential to be free.::Manuel Puig
Ironically, Latin American countries, in their instability, give writers and intellectuals the hope that they are needed.::Manuel Puig

It was very clear to me in 1965, in Mississippi, that, as a lawyer, I could get people into schools, desegregate the schools, but if they were kicked off the plantations - and if they didn't have food, didn't have jobs, didn't have health care, didn't have the means to exercise those civil rights, we were not going to have success.::Marian Wright Edelman
No person has the right to rain on your dreams.::Marian Wright Edelman

Unless children have strong education and strong families and strong communities and decent housing, it's not enough to go sit in at a lunch counter.::Marian Wright Edelman

Courage! I have shown it for years think you I shall lose it at the moment when my sufferings are to end?::Marie Antoinette

My work is the only ground I've ever had to stand on. I seem to have a whole superstructure with no foundation but I'm working on the foundation.::Marilyn Monroe

An actor is supposed to be a sensitive instrument. Isaac Stern takes good care of his violin. What if everybody jumped on his violin?::Marilyn Monroe
Experts on romance say for a happy marriage there has to be more than a passionate love. For a lasting union, they insist, there must be a genuine liking for each other. Which, in my book, is a good definition for friendship.::Marilyn Monroe
What good am I? I can't have kids. I can't cook. I've been divorced three times. Who would want me?::Marilyn Monroe
I don't want to make money, I just want to be wonderful.::Marilyn Monroe
Sometimes I've been to a party where no one spoke to me for a whole evening. The men, frightened by their wives or sweeties, would give me a wide berth. And the ladies would gang up in a corner to discuss my dangerous character.::Marilyn Monroe
A man has a tendency to accept you the way you are, while most women immediately start to pick flaws and want to change you.::Marilyn Monroe

What good is it being Marilyn Monroe? Why can't I just be an ordinary woman?::Marilyn Monroe
I am good, but not an angel. I do sin, but I am not the devil. I am just a small girl in a big world trying to find someone to love.::Marilyn Monroe
Girls shouldn't worry about being the equal of men in the business world.::Marilyn Monroe
Some of my foster families used to send me to the movies to get me out of the house and there I'd sit all day and way into the night.

I loved anything that moved up there and I didn't miss anything that happened and there was no popcorn either.::Marilyn Monroe
I don't know if high society is different in other cities, but in Hollywood, important people can't stand to be invited someplace that isn't full of other important people. They don't mind a few unfamous people being present because they make good listeners.::Marilyn Monroe
Someday I want to have children and give them all the love I never had.::Marilyn Monroe
Sometimes I feel my whole life has been one big rejection.::Marilyn Monroe
It's often just enough to be with someone. I don't need to touch them. Not even talk. A feeling passes between you both. You're not alone.::Marilyn Monroe

All we need, really, is a change from a near frigid to a tropical attitude of mind.::Marjory Stoneman Douglas
The only person who had any control was Jonathan Harris. His character was so flamboyant that he was able to make things happen. My character was fairly one-dimensional, so I had my relationship with Dr. Smith and with the family.::Mark Goddard
It's amazing that this is all happening to Lost in Space.::Mark Goddard
Life is about family and technology.::Mark Goddard
I was supposed to have a relationship with Judy, but that never happened. Actors in series didn't have the control that they have today over their jobs.::Mark Goddard
One thing that is almost always said to me is, I grew up with you. They are meeting me and feel that they actually grew up with me. I was with them during their play hours and thinking hours. I was a part of their childhoods. That's one of the most amazing things.::Mark Goddard
I'm not a great science fiction fan myself. I probably feel that way about Westerns. Like I used to play Cowboys and Indians, they can act out Will and the Robot.::Mark Goddard
If we can by any method establish a relation of mutual trust between the laborer and the employer, we shall lay the foundation stone of a structure that will endure for all time.::Mark Hanna
The New Right, in many cases, is doing nothing less than placing a heretical claim on Christian faith that distorts, confuses, and destroys the opportunity for a biblical understanding of Jesus Christ and of his gospel for millions of people.::Mark Hatfield
As a Christian, there is no other part of the New Right ideology that concerns me more than its self-serving misuse of religious faith.::Mark Hatfield
Humor is very very risky, particularly for a candidate, unless he's been in so long that it just doesn't matter, and he's not running for president. But it's just that people are so sensitive and so touchy, and you're just going to upset somebody without ever realizing it.::Mark Russell
The scientific theory I like best is that the rings of Saturn are composed entirely of lost airline luggage.::Mark Russell
It's very difficult to break into motion pictures, but it's oddly easier for directors today because of independent films and cable, who have inherited for the most part those films of substance that the studios are reluctant to finance.::Mark Rydell
It's sad - it's sad for us old enough to remember when directors ruled, and films were substantially better than they are today. But it's hard to argue with those kinds of grosses.::Mark Rydell
There's evidence of a social decline in direct proportion to technology and the industrialization of the motion picture industry.::Mark Rydell
There is always strength in numbers. The more individuals or organizations that you can rally to your cause, the better.::Mark Shields
And yet, in a culture like ours, which is given to material comforts, and addicted to forms of entertainment that offer immediate gratification, it is surprising that so much poetry is written.::Mark Strand
Poetry is something that happens in universities, in creative writing programs or in English departments.::Mark Strand

Poetry is, first and last, language - the rest is filler.::Mark Strand
And at least in poetry you should feel free to lie. That is, not to lie, but to imagine what you want, to follow the direction of the poem.::Mark Strand
A life is not sufficiently elevated for poetry, unless, of course, the life has been made into an art.::Mark Strand
It's very hard to write humor.::Mark Strand
I think the best American poetry is the poetry that utilizes the resources of poetry rather than exploits the defects or triumphs of the poet's personality.::Mark Strand
The future is always beginning now.::Mark Strand
Usually a life turned into a poem is misrepresented.::Mark Strand
Pain is filtered in a poem so that it becomes finally, in the end, pleasure.::Mark Strand
I certainly can't speak for all cultures or all societies, but it's clear that in America, poetry serves a very marginal purpose. It's not part of the cultural mainstream.::Mark Strand
I would say that American poetry has always been a poetry of personal testimony.::Mark Strand
A great many people seem to think writing poetry is worthwhile, even though it pays next to nothing and is not as widely read as it should be.::Mark Strand

I never thought I was a great mom. I always worked. I fell in love with my children as they got older.::Marla Gibbs
I truly believe that everything that we do and everyone that we meet is put in our path for a purpose.

In my life I've learned that true happiness comes from giving. Helping others along the way makes you evaluate who you are. I think that love is what we're all searching for. I haven't come across anyone who didn't become a better person through love.::Marla Gibbs

I never enjoyed working in a film.::Marlene Dietrich

Never face facts if you do you'll never get up in the morning.::Marlo Thomas
In the 1960s we were fighting to be recognized as equals in the marketplace, in marriage, in education and on the playing field. It was a very exciting, rebellious time.::Marlo Thomas
One of the things about equality is not just that you be treated equally to a man, but that you treat yourself equally to the way you treat a man.::Marlo Thomas

When I look back at those pictures of my mother performing - and listen to her recordings - it makes me sad to think that all of that joy she found in her work came to an end. I wish she hadn't had to make that sacrifice, even if it was for the benefit of my father and siblings and me.::Marlo Thomas
Today, all patients accepted for treatment at St. Jude's are treated without regard for the family's ability to pay. Everything beyond what is covered by insurance is taken care of, and for those without insurance, all of the medical costs are absorbed by the hospital.::Marlo Thomas
I think loss of loved ones is the hardest blow in life.::Marlo Thomas
The rejection that we all take and the sadness and the aggravation and the loss of jobs and all of the things that we live through in our lives, without a sense of humor, I don't know how people make it.::Marlo Thomas
I don't think homosexuality is a choice. Society forces you to think it's a choice, but in fact, it's in one's nature. The choice is whether one expresses one's nature truthfully or spends the rest of one's life lying about it.::Marlo Thomas
I don't mind that I'm fat. You still get the same money.::Marlon Brando

Societies have always been shaped more by the nature of the media by which men communicate than by the content of the communication.::Marshall McLuhan

It would be a bitter cosmic joke if we destroy ourselves due to atrophy of the imagination.::Martha Gellhorn
Why do people talk of the horrors of old age? It's great. I feel like a fine old car with the parts gradually wearing out, but I'm not complaining,... Those who find growing old terrible are people who haven't done what they wanted with their lives.::Martha Gellhorn
After the desperate years of their own war, after six years of repression inside Spain and six years of horror in exile, these people remain intact in spirit. They are armed with a transcendent faith they have never won, and yet they have never accepted defeat.::Martha Gellhorn

First, I think the science of monetary economics has clearly gotten better.::Martin Feldstein

War is not the answer, because only love can conquer hate.::Marvin Gaye

How can a Man respect his Wife when he has a contemptible Opinion of her and her Sex?::Mary Astell
Hitherto I have courted Truth with a kind of Romantick Passion, in spite of all Difficulties and Discouragements: for knowledge is thought so unnecessary an Accomplishment for a Woman, that few will give themselves the Trouble to assist us in the Attainment of it.::Mary Astell
English girls' schools today providing the higher education are, so far as my knowledge goes, worthily representative of that astonishing rise in the intellectual standards of women which has taken place in the last half-century.::Mary Augusta Ward
The answer, of course, in the mouth of a Christian teacher is that in Christianity alone is there both present joy and future hope.::Mary Augusta Ward
For after my marriage I had made various attempts to write fiction. They were clearly failures.::Mary Augusta Ward
It became plain very soon after our marriage that ours was to be a literary partnership.::Mary Augusta Ward
I wanted to show how a man of sensitive and noble character, born for religion, comes to throw off the orthodoxies of his day and moment, and to go out into the wilderness where all is experiment, and spiritual life begins again.::Mary Augusta Ward

Inequality can have a bad downside, but equality, for its part, sure does get in the way of coordination.::Mary Douglas
It is only partly true that religion does more harm than good in society. The community makes God into the image it wants, vengeful, or milky sweet, or scrupulously just, and so on.::Mary Douglas
Religion can make it worse. Are you supposing that if people were encouraged to believe in a transcendent reality, and to be encouraged by grand rituals and music and preaching, to love their neighbors, then they would put jealousy and frustration aside?::Mary Douglas
I am sure it must be true that people opt out of the mainstream society because they feel that there are going to be no rewards for them, if they stay.::Mary Douglas
If you want to change the culture, you will have to start by changing the organization.::Mary Douglas
Mormons... are so strong, they can handle wealth, they are confident. I think it is because they are not bogged down by rules for equality, but have a firmly defined system of relative status and responsible command.::Mary Douglas
It seems true that the growth of science and secularism made organized Christianity feel under threat.::Mary Douglas
I have increasingly, over the years, felt that religion today does our civilization more harm than good.::Mary Douglas
It is very reasonable to worry about the harm done by organized religion, and to prefer looser and more private arrangements.::Mary Douglas
Real equality is immensely difficult to achieve, it needs continual revision and monitoring of distributions. And it does not provide buffers between members, so they are continually colliding or frustrating each other.::Mary Douglas
Christmas, children, is not a date. It is a state of mind.::Mary Ellen Chase

Krishna children were taught that in the spiritual world there were no parents, only souls and hence this justified their being kept out of view from others, cloistered in separate buildings and sheltered from the evil material world.::Mary Garden

A company is only as good as the people it keeps.::Mary Kay Ash
We fall forward to succeed.::Mary Kay Ash
Don't limit yourself. Many people limit themselves to what they think they can do. You can go as far as your mind lets you. What you believe, remember, you can achieve.::Mary Kay Ash
Most people live and die with their music still unplayed. They never dare to try.::Mary Kay Ash
Everyone has an invisible sign hanging from their neck saying, 'Make me feel important.' Never forget this message when working with people.::Mary Kay Ash

To live in this world, you must be able to do three things: to love what is mortal to hold it against your bones knowing your own life depends on it and, when the time comes to let it go, to let it go.::Mary Oliver
I simply do not distinguish between work and play.::Mary Oliver
I very much wished not to be noticed, and to be left alone, and I sort of succeeded.::Mary Oliver
When it's over, I want to say: all my life I was a bride married to amazement. I was the bridegroom, taking the world into my arms.::Mary Oliver
Poetry isn't a profession, it's a way of life. It's an empty basket you put your life into it and make something out of that.::Mary Oliver
We all have a hungry heart, and one of the things we hunger for is happiness. So as much as I possibly could, I stayed where I was happy. I spent a great deal of time in my younger years just writing and reading, walking around the woods in Ohio, where I grew up.::Mary Oliver
The past cannot be changed. The future is yet in your power.::Mary Pickford
You may have a fresh start any moment you choose, for this thing that we call 'failure' is not the falling down, but the staying down.::Mary Pickford
Adding sound to movies would be like putting lipstick on the Venus de Milo.::Mary Pickford

Take chances, make mistakes. That's how you grow. Pain nourishes your courage. You have to fail in order to practice being brave.::Mary Tyler Moore
Nature's music is never over her silences are pauses, not conclusions.::Mary Webb

We're all like children. We may think we grow up, but to me, being grown up is death, stopping thinking, trying to find out things, going on learning.::Mary Wesley
I was sent to a finishing school, which didn't last long when mother found out how badly chaperoned we were. Then I 'came out' before going to a domestic science school.::Mary Wesley
Women's courage is rather different from men's. The fact that women have to bring up children and look after husbands makes them braver at facing long-term issues, such as illness. Men are more immediately courageous. Lots of people are brave in battle.::Mary Wesley
My father was a soldier and my mother was a great mover. She once counted up how many places she had lived in during the first 25 years of her marriage and it came to 20.::Mary Wesley
Each marriage has to be judged separately, and we never know what's going on in another person's marriage.::Mary Wesley
People try much less hard to make a marriage work than they used to fifty years ago. Divorce is easier.::Mary Wesley
That image of the countryside being a threatening place still exists. People continue to resist the challenge of learning about aspects of life they don't understand.::Mary Wesley
Twenty years ago, I was living in a lovely cottage on the edge of Dartmoor but I couldn't afford to run a car.::Mary Wesley
I remember the evacuee children from towns and cities throwing stones at the farm animals. When we explained that if you did that you wouldn't have any milk, meat or eggs, they soon learned to respect the animals.::Mary Wesley
Imagination which comes into play in falling in love is different from any other. Certainly in my case, and I've fallen in love all my life, one imagines the person to be as you want them to be. They frequently turn out to be someone different, for better or worse.::Mary Wesley
I have deliberately left Sylvester and Julia's appearances to the reader's imagination.::Mary Wesley
Children, I grant, should be innocent but when the epithet is applied to men, or women, it is but a civil term for weakness.::Mary Wollstonecraft

In every age there has been a stream of popular opinion that has carried all before it, and given a family character, as it were, to the century.::Mary Wollstonecraft
Women are degraded by the propensity to enjoy the present moment, and, at last, despise the freedom which they have not sufficient virtue to struggle to attain.::Mary Wollstonecraft
Taught from infancy that beauty is woman's sceptre, the mind shapes itself to the body, and roaming round its gilt cage, only seeks to adorn its prison.::Mary Wollstonecraft
If American men are obsessed with money, American women are obsessed with weight. The men talk of gain, the women talk of loss, and I do not know which talk is the more boring.::Marya Mannes
It is not enough to show people how to live better: there is a mandate for any group with enormous powers of communication to show people how to be better.::Marya Mannes
The curse of the romantic is a greed for dreams, an intensity of expectation that, in the end, diminishes the reality.::Marya Mannes
In aid, the proper attitude is one omitting gratitude.::Marya Mannes
In our society those who are in reality superior in intelligence can be accepted by their fellows only if they pretend they are not.::Marya Mannes

All really great lovers are articulate, and verbal seduction is the surest road to actual seduction.::Marya Mannes
Women are repeatedly accused of taking things personally. I cannot see any other honest way of taking them.::Marya Mannes
For every five well-adjusted and smoothly functioning Americans, there are two who never had the chance to discover themselves. It may well be because they have never been alone with themselves.::Marya Mannes

If, then, faith widens the connections, it elevates the man.::Matthew Simpson
I do not purpose to discuss faith in its dogmatic sense today.::Matthew Simpson
If, then, knowledge be power, how much more power to we gain through the agency of faith, and what elevation must it give to human character.::Matthew Simpson
The realm of immediate or personal knowledge is a narrow circle in which these bodies move the realm of knowledge derived through faith is as wide as the universe, and old as eternity.::Matthew Simpson
When I was about 15... I made my first attempt as a leading lady, and was, of course, a complete failure.::Maude Adams

I adored Mickey Mouse when I was a child. He was the emblem of happiness and funniness.::Maurice Sendak
Do parents sit down and tell their kids everything? I don't know. I don't know. I've convinced myself - I hope I'm right - that children despair of you if you don't tell them the truth.::Maurice Sendak
I think people should be given a test much like driver's tests as to whether they're capable of being parents! It's an art form. I talk a lot. And I think a lot. And I draw a lot. But never in a million years would I have been a parent. That's just work that's too hard.::Maurice Sendak
My life in Brooklyn was in constant danger because of my bad health.::Maurice Sendak

I'm not afraid of death.::Maurice Sendak
The distinctions of fine art bore me to death.::Maurice Sendak
Girls are infinitely more complicated than boys and women more than men. And there's no doubt about that. We just don't like to think about it. Certainly the men don't like to think about it.::Maurice Sendak
Most children - I know I did when I was a kid - fantasize another set of parents. Or fantasize no parents. They don't tell their real parents about that - you don't want to tell Mom and Dad. Kids lead a very private life. And I was a typical child, I think. I was a liar.::Maurice Sendak
I don't need faith.::Maurice Sendak
As a kid, all I thought about was death. But you can't tell your parents that.::Maurice Sendak
In plain terms, a child is a complicated creature who can drive you crazy. There's a cruelty to childhood, there's an anger.::Maurice Sendak
When I did 'Bumble-ardy,' I was so intensely aware of death. Eugene, my friend and partner, was dying here in the house when I did 'Bumble-ardy'. I did 'Bumble-ardy' to save myself. I did not want to die with him. I wanted to live, as any human being does.::Maurice Sendak
My father could be very witty, even if the humor was always on the darker side of irony.::Maurice Sendak
To get a child's trust - you may know or not - is a very hard thing to do. They're so used to not believing adults - because adults tell tales and lies all the time.::Maurice Sendak

I hate those e-books. They can not be the future... they may well be... I will be dead.::Maurice Sendak
Oh, I adored Mickey Mouse when I was a child. He was the emblem of happiness and funniness. You went to the movies then, you saw two movies and a short. When Mickey Mouse came on the screen and there was his big head, my sister said she had to hold onto me. I went berserk.::Maurice Sendak
I want to be alone and work until the day my heads hits the drawing table and I'm dead. Kaput. I feel very much like I want to be with my brother and sister again. They're nowhere. I know they're nowhere and they don't exist, but if nowhere means that's where they are, that's where I want to be.::Maurice Sendak
Most children - I know I did when I was a kid - fantasize another set of parents. Or fantasize no parents. They don't tell their real parents about that - you don't want to tell Mom and Dad.::Maurice Sendak
I mean, being a child was being a child, was being a creature without power, without pocket money, without escape routes of any kind. So I didn't want to be a child.::Maurice Sendak
I hate those e-books. They cannot be the future. They may well be.::Maurice Sendak

We owe at least this much to future generations, from whom we have borrowed a fragile planet called Earth.::Maurice Strong
Toyota was the first to put a commercial fuel cell powered car on the road, and I have no doubt that Toyota will continue to be in the front lines in the development of competitive fuel cell vehicles.::Maurice Strong
I learn something from criticism because when it comes from sources you respect you always examine it and learn.::Maurice Strong
After all, sustainability means running the global environment - Earth Inc. - like a corporation: with depreciation, amortization and maintenance accounts. In other words, keeping the asset whole, rather than undermining your natural capital.::Maurice Strong
I've developed a huge regard for Toyota for its environmental awareness, for its immense commitment to research and development in this field, and for its leadership in developing hybrids which others are now following.::Maurice Strong
I am President of the UN created University for Peace, which has a strong commitment to the relationship between peace, security and the environment. I meet with young people around the world and I always come away enthused and encouraged.::Maurice Strong
Also, it is interesting that developing countries, with China and India perhaps in the lead, where the future of the global environment will be decided are now on board with the case for sustainable development.::Maurice Strong
A shift is necessary toward lifestyles less geared to environmental damaging consumption patterns.::Maurice Strong
In addition to this, they already have a fuel cell car on the road in Japan. It is subsidized from within the corporation because they are still at a high cost.::Maurice Strong
Art is creative for the sake of realization, not for amusement... for transfiguration, not for the sake of play.::Max Beckmann

People who insist on telling their dreams are among the terrors of the breakfast table.::Max Beerbohm
You will find that the woman who is really kind to dogs is always one who has failed to inspire sympathy in men.::Max Beerbohm
It seems to be a law of nature that no man, unless he has some obvious physical deformity, ever is loth to sit for his portrait.::Max Beerbohm

Most women are not as young as they are painted.::Max Beerbohm
To give and then not feel that one has given is the very best of all ways of giving.::Max Beerbohm
If God has made the world a perfect mechanism, He has at least conceded so much to our imperfect intellect that in order to predict little parts of it, we need not solve innumerable differential equations, but can use dice with fair success.::Max Born
It is art that makes life, makes interest, makes importance and I know of no substitute whatever for the force and beauty of its process.::Max Eastman

You may call for peace as loudly as you wish, but where there is no brotherhood there can in the end be no peace.::Max Lerner
If I despised myself, it would be no compensation if everyone saluted me, and if I respect myself, it does not trouble me if others hold me lightly.::Max Nordau
Civilization is built on a number of ultimate principles... respect for human life, the punishment of crimes against property and persons, the equality of all good citizens before the law... or, in a word justice.::Max Nordau
A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.::Max Planck

We have no right to assume that any physical laws exist, or if they have existed up until now, that they will continue to exist in a similar manner in the future.::Max Planck
Anybody who has been seriously engaged in scientific work of any kind realizes that over the entrance to the gates of the temple of science are written the words: 'Ye must have faith.'::Max Planck
It is not the possession of truth, but the success which attends the seeking after it, that enriches the seeker and brings happiness to him.::Max Planck
Science cannot solve the ultimate mystery of nature. And that is because, in the last analysis, we ourselves are a part of the mystery that we are trying to solve.::Max Planck
A scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.::Max Planck
Whence come I and whither go I? That is the great unfathomable question, the same for every one of us. Science has no answer to it.::Max Planck

First love is first love, first marriage is first marriage, disappointment is disappointment.::Maximilian Schell
A conversation goes sometimes into personal things and that's nicer. You look to each other and you have a different picture, you get into a relationship.::Maximilian Schell

This nation has always struggled with how it was going to deal with poor people and people of color. Every few years you will see some great change in the way that they approach this. We've had the war on poverty that never really got into waging a real war on poverty.::Maxine Waters

Funny things happen to you in movies for silly reasons.::Michael Caine
I am in so many movies that are on TV at 2:00 a.m. that people think I am dead.::Michael Caine

I think what is British about me is my feelings and awareness of others and their situations.

If we are heartbroken, we don't scream in your face with tears - we go home and cry on our own.::Michael Caine
Hollywood is a cross between a health farm, a recreation center and an insane asylum. It's a company town, and I happen to like the company!::Michael Caine

I'm every bourgeois nightmare - a Cockney with intelligence and a million dollars.::Michael Caine
My wife comes with me on all the movies, but she is not an appendage to a film star or anything like that. She is a completely intertwined partner. She is the other half of me. Also, we're still very much in love with each other. We always have been, we always will be.::Michael Caine
My problem was that I was blond. There were no heroes with blond hair. Robert Taylor and Henry Fonda, they all had dark hair. The only one I found was Van Johnson, who wasn't too cool. He was a nice, homely American boy. So I created my own image. It worked.::Michael Caine
No architect troubled to design houses that suited people who were to live in them, because that would have meant building a whole range of different houses. It was far cheaper and, above all, timesaving to make them identical.::Michael Ende

I don't believe in morality in architecture.::Michael Graves
In any architecture, there is an equity between the pragmatic function and the symbolic function.::Michael Graves

This is true enough, but success is the next best thing to happiness, and if you can't be happy as a success, it's very unlikely that you would find a deeper, truer happiness in failure.::Michael Korda
The freedom to fail is vital if you're going to succeed. Most successful people fail from time to time, and it is a measure of their strength that failure merely propels them into some new attempt at success.::Michael Korda
Success on any major scale requires you to accept responsibility... in the final analysis, the one quality that all successful people have... is the ability to take on responsibility.::Michael Korda

One way to keep momentum going is to have constantly greater goals.::Michael Korda
You can die of the cure before you die of the illness.::Michael Landon
I don't have expectations. Expectations in your life just lead to giant disappointments.::Michael Landon
I've had a good life. Enough happiness, enough success.::Michael Landon
I believe in God, family, truth between people, the power of love.::Michael Landon
With a houseful of kids you give each other strength.::Michael Landon
Love is not a feeling of happiness. Love is a willingness to sacrifice.::Michael Novak
We really feel happier when things look bleak. Hope is endurance. Hope is holding on and going on and trusting in the Lord.::Michael Novak
I shall suggest, on the contrary, that all communication relies, to a noticeable extent on evoking knowledge that we cannot tell, and that all our knowledge of mental processes, like feelings or conscious intellectual activities, is based on a knowledge which we cannot tell.::Michael Polanyi
The process of philosophic and scientific enlightenment has shaken the stability of beliefs held explicitly as articles of faith.::Michael Polanyi
Human beings exercise responsibilities within a social setting and a framework of obligations which transcend the principle of intelligence.::Michael Polanyi
Reason is an action of the mind knowledge is a possession of the mind but faith is an attitude of the person. It means you are prepared to stake yourself on something being so.::Michael Ramsey
Ken Lay has, does and will continue to accept responsibility for the fall of Enron. He was the man at the controls. But failure is not a crime.::Michael Ramsey

In the inhalation and exhalation there is an energy and a lively divine spirit, since He, through his spirit supports the breath of life, giving courage to the people who are in the earth and spirit to those who walk on it.::Michael Servetus
Music is a performance and needs the audience.::Michael Tippett
Shakespeare fascinated me. He hardly ever left the country. His imagination was worldwide though reading.::Michael Tippett

My true function within a society which embraces all of us is to continue an age-old tradition. This tradition is to create images from the depths of the imagination and to give them form, whether visual, intellectual or musical.::Michael Tippett

The strategic adversary is fascism... the fascism in us all, in our heads and in our everyday behavior, the fascism that causes us to love power, to desire the very thing that dominates and exploits us.::Michel Foucault
Prison continues, on those who are entrusted to it, a work begun elsewhere, which the whole of society pursues on each individual through innumerable mechanisms of discipline.::Michel Foucault
What strikes me is the fact that in our society, art has become something which is only related to objects, and not to individuals, or to life.::Michel Foucault
Justice must always question itself, just as society can exist only by means of the work it does on itself and on its institutions.::Michel Foucault
Power is not an institution, and not a structure neither is it a certain strength we are endowed with it is the name that one attributes to a complex strategical situation in a particular society.::Michel Foucault

It is a sign of contraction of the mind when it is content, or of weariness. A spirited mind never stops within itself it is always aspiring and going beyond its strength.::Michel de Montaigne
I put forward formless and unresolved notions, as do those who publish doubtful questions to debate in the schools, not to establish the truth but to seek it.::Michel de Montaigne
There are some defeats more triumphant than victories.::Michel de Montaigne
Age imprints more wrinkles in the mind than it does on the face.::Michel de Montaigne
If there is such a thing as a good marriage, it is because it resembles friendship rather than love.::Michel de Montaigne
It is not death, it is dying that alarms me.::Michel de Montaigne
Every one rushes elsewhere and into the future, because no one wants to face one's own inner self.::Michel de Montaigne
How many things we held yesterday as articles of faith which today we tell as fables.::Michel de Montaigne
Let us permit nature to have her way. She understands her business better than we do.::Michel de Montaigne

The Wayne Education Building was the first classroom building that we have done on the Wayne campus.::Minoru Yamasaki

We build buildings which are terribly restless. And buildings don't go anywhere. They shouldn't be restless.::Minoru Yamasaki
Japanese architecture is very much copied in this country and in Europe.::Minoru Yamasaki
If you examine this, I think that you will find that it's the mechanics of Japanese architecture that have been thought of as the direct influence upon our architecture.::Minoru Yamasaki
I want to do very useful buildings and I would like to find a method of producing these buildings through our technology because I think that this is the only way that we will gain wonderful environment easily in the future.::Minoru Yamasaki

In the mind, in the heart, I was always home. I always imagined, really, going back home.::Miriam Makeba
Everybody now admits that apartheid was wrong, and all I did was tell the people who wanted to know where I come from how we lived in South Africa. I just told the world the truth. And if my truth then becomes political, I can't do anything about that.::Miriam Makeba
And why is our music called world music? I think people are being polite. What they want to say is that it's third world music. Like they use to call us under developed countries, now it has changed to developing countries, it's much more polite.::Miriam Makeba

Dying is only one thing to be sad over... Living unhappily is something else.::Morrie Schwartz
The little things, I can obey. But the big things - how we think, what we value - those you must choose yourself. You can't let anyone - or any society - determine those for you.::Morrie Schwartz

A creative element is surely present in all great systems, and it does not seem possible that all sympathy or fundamental attitudes of will can be entirely eliminated from any human philosophy.::Morris Raphael Cohen
Liberalism is an attitude rather than a set of dogmas - an attitude that insists upon questioning all plausible and self-evident propositions, seeking not to reject them but to find out what evidence there is to support them rather than their possible alternatives.::Morris Raphael Cohen
Cruel persecutions and intolerance are not accidents, but grow out of the very essence of religion, namely, its absolute claims.::Morris Raphael Cohen
The fact is that the learning process goes on, and so long as the voices are not stilled and the singers go on singing some of it gets through.::Morris West

Instead, it appears to be a particular mark of beauty that it is considered with tranquil satisfaction that it pleases if we also do not possess it and we are still far removed from demanding to possess it.::Moses Mendelssohn
I fear that, in the end, the famous debate among materialists, idealists, and dualists amounts to a merely verbal dispute that is more a matter for the linguist than for the speculative philosopher.::Moses Mendelssohn
It was in our power to cause the Arab governments to renounce the policy of strength toward Israel by turning it into a demonstration of weakness.::Moshe Dayan
If you want to make peace, you don't talk to your friends. You talk to your enemies.::Moshe Dayan
I have traveled a long road from the battlefield to the peace table.::Moshe Dayan

I have the strength to endure it all.::Moshe Dayan
Freedom is the oxygen of the soul.::Moshe Dayan
Arabs respect only the language of force.::Moshe Sharett
Our role in Israel is a pioneering one, and we need people with certain strength of fiber.::Moshe Sharett

Joy is a net of love by which you can catch souls.::Mother Teresa
Let us more and more insist on raising funds of love, of kindness, of understanding, of peace. Money will come if we seek first the Kingdom of God - the rest will be given.::Mother Teresa
Our life of poverty is as necessary as the work itself. Only in heaven will we see how much we owe to the poor for helping us to love God better because of them.::Mother Teresa
Let us not be satisfied with just giving money. Money is not enough, money can be got, but they need your hearts to love them. So, spread your love everywhere you go.::Mother Teresa
Many people mistake our work for our vocation. Our vocation is the love of Jesus.::Mother Teresa
Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier.::Mother Teresa
We need to find God, and he cannot be found in noise and restlessness. God is the friend of silence. See how nature - trees, flowers, grass- grows in silence see the stars, the moon and the sun, how they move in silence... We need silence to be able to touch souls.::Mother Teresa
One of the greatest diseases is to be nobody to anybody.::Mother Teresa
The greatest destroyer of peace is abortion because if a mother can kill her own child, what is left for me to kill you and you to kill me? There is nothing between.::Mother Teresa

Peace begins with a smile.::Mother Teresa
The miracle is not that we do this work, but that we are happy to do it.::Mother Teresa
Love is a fruit in season at all times, and within reach of every hand.::Mother Teresa
If you want a love message to be heard, it has got to be sent out. To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it.::Mother Teresa
There is always the danger that we may just do the work for the sake of the work. This is where the respect and the love and the devotion come in - that we do it to God, to Christ, and that's why we try to do it as beautifully as possible.::Mother Teresa
The hunger for love is much more difficult to remove than the hunger for bread.::Mother Teresa
Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love.::Mother Teresa
If we have no peace, it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other.::Mother Teresa
Beside all this I think there was something personal, being Muslim myself who lived in the west I felt that it was my obligation my duty to tell the truth about Islam. It is a religion that has a 700 million following, yet it's so little known about it which surprised me.::Moustapha Akkad
Baalbek is so beautiful. It is the heart of beauty in the Middle East - I want to embrace these people with my music. I will try so hard for them. Their president is a Christian, their prime minister is a Muslim. Music is for everyone.::Mstislav Rostropovich
When I started learning the cello, I fell in love with the instrument because it seemed like a voice - my voice.::Mstislav Rostropovich
People are craving this great progress in electronics, going after computers, the Internet, etc. It's a giant progress technologically. But they must have a balance of soul, a balance for human beauty. That means art has an important role.::Mstislav Rostropovich
I stone got crazy when I saw somebody run down them strings with a bottleneck. My eyes lit up like a Christmas tree and I said that I had to learn.::Muddy Waters
I was so wild and crazy and dumb in my car. It didn't run but 30 miles an hour. You made do.::Muddy Waters
I got up one Christmas morning and we didn't have nothing to eat. We didn't have an apple, we didn't have an orange, we didn't have a cake, we didn't have nothing.::Muddy Waters

Pakistan not only means freedom and independence but the Muslim Ideology which has to be preserved, which has come to us as a precious gift and treasure and which, we hope other will share with us.::Muhammad Ali Jinnah
With faith, discipline and selfless devotion to duty, there is nothing worthwhile that you cannot achieve.::Muhammad Ali Jinnah
Come forward as servants of Islam, organise the people economically, socially, educationally and politically and I am sure that you will be a power that will be accepted by everybody.::Muhammad Ali Jinnah

Islam expect every Muslim to do this duty, and if we realise our responsibility time will come soon when we shall justify ourselves worthy of a glorious past.::Muhammad Ali Jinnah

Expect the best, Prepare for the worst.::Muhammad Ali Jinnah
That freedom can never be attained by a nation without suffering and sacrifice has been amply borne out by the recent tragic happenings in this subcontinent.::Muhammad Ali Jinnah

We should have a State in which we could live and breathe as free men and which we could develop according to our own lights and culture and where principles of Islamic social justice could find free play.::Muhammad Ali Jinnah
Failure is a word unknown to me.::Muhammad Ali Jinnah
It is the nature of the self to manifest itself, In every atom slumbers the might of the self.::Muhammad Iqbal
Inductive reason, which alone makes man master of his environment, is an achievement and when once born it must be reinforced by inhibiting the growth of other modes of knowledge.::Muhammad Iqbal
But inner experience is only one source of human knowledge.::Muhammad Iqbal
It may, however, be said that the level of experience to which concepts are inapplicable cannot yield any knowledge of a universal character, for concepts alone are capable of being socialized.::Muhammad Iqbal
The ultimate aim of the ego is not to see something, but to be something.::Muhammad Iqbal
The scientific observer of Nature is a kind of mystic seeker in the act of prayer.::Muhammad Iqbal
Indeed, in view of its function, religion stands in greater need of a rational foundation of its ultimate principles than even the dogmas of science.::Muhammad Iqbal
The truth is that the religious and the scientific processes, though involving different methods, are identical in their final aim. Both aim at reaching the most real.::Muhammad Iqbal
The possibility of a scientific treatment of history means a wider experience, a greater maturity of practical reason, and finally a fuller realization of certain basic ideas regarding the nature of life and time.::Muhammad Iqbal
Ends and purposes, whether they exist as conscious or subconscious tendencies, form the wrap and woof of our conscious experience.::Muhammad Iqbal
The Ego is partly free. partly determined, and reaches fuller freedom by approaching the Individual who is most free: God.::Muhammad Iqbal
If the object of poetry is, to make men, then poetry is the heir of prophecy.::Muhammad Iqbal
The immediacy of mystic experience simply means that we know God just as we know other objects. God is not a mathematical entity or a system of concepts mutually related to one another and having no reference to experience.::Muhammad Iqbal
Yet higher religion, which is only a search for a larger life, is essentially experience and recognized the necessity of experience as its foundation long before science learnt to do so.::Muhammad Iqbal
Words, without power, is mere philosophy.::Muhammad Iqbal
The ultimate purpose of religious life is to make this evolution move in a direction far more important to the destiny of the ego than the moral health of the social fabric which forms his present environment.::Muhammad Iqbal
Art: If the object of poetry is, to make men, then poetry is the heir of prophecy.::Muhammad Iqbal
Another way of judging the value of a prophet's religious experience, therefore, would be to examine the type of manhood that he has created, and the cultural world that has sprung out of the spirit of his message.::Muhammad Iqbal
If faith is lost, there is no security and there is no life for him who does not adhere to religion.::Muhammad Iqbal
God is not a dead equation!::Muhammad Iqbal
I lead no party I follow no leader. I have given the best part of my life to careful study of Islam, its law and polity, its culture, its history and its literature.::Muhammad Iqbal
Vision without power does bring moral elevation but cannot give a lasting culture.::Muhammad Iqbal
When truth has no burning, then it is philosophy, when it gets burning from the heart, it becomes poetry.::Muhammad Iqbal
The standpoint of the man who relies on religious experience for capturing Reality must always remain individual and incommunicable.::Muhammad Iqbal
People who have no hold over their process of thinking are likely to be ruined by liberty of thought. If thought is immature, liberty of thought becomes a method of converting men into animals.::Muhammad Iqbal
If there were no poetry on any day in the world, poetry would be invented that day. For there would be an intolerable hunger.::Muriel Rukeyser
Breathe-in experience, breathe-out poetry.::Muriel Rukeyser
The sources of poetry are in the spirit seeking completeness.::Muriel Rukeyser
To me education is a leading out of what is already there in the pupil's soul. To Miss Mackay it is a putting in of something that is not there, and that is not what I call education. I call it intrusion.::Muriel Spark
It is impossible to persuade a man who does not disagree, but smiles.::Muriel Spark
When a noble life has prepared old age, it is not decline that it reveals, but the first days of immortality.::Muriel Spark
So the old Copenhagen interpretation needs to be generalized, needs to be replaced by something that can be used for the whole universe, and can be used also in cases where there is plenty of individuality and history.::Murray Gell-Mann
You know, there was a time, just before I started to study physical science, when astronomers thought that systems such as we have here in the solar system required a rare triple collision of stars.::Murray Gell-Mann
As a theoretical physicist, I feel at once proud and humble at the thought of the illustrious figures that have preceded me here to receive the greatest of all honors in science, the Nobel prize.::Murray Gell-Mann
The beauty of a strong, lasting commitment is often best understood by men incapable of it.::Murray Kempton
It is in war that the State really comes into its own: swelling in power, in number, in pride, in absolute dominion over the economy and the society.::Murray Rothbard
If you don't trust someone to look after your investments, then they shouldn't be doing the job for you.::Murray Walker
That's history. I say history because it happened in the past.::Murray Walker
I'm a car fanatic and each morning I wake up with a smile on my face, whether I'm commentating on the Formula One or at Silver Hatch racetrack in Roary the Racing Car.::Murray Walker
And that just shows you how important the car is in Formula One Racing.::Murray Walker
There's nothing wrong with the car except that it's on fire.::Murray Walker
Either the car is stationary, or it's on the move.::Murray Walker
Like everybody, I have invested in things that have gone bad, because there's never any guarantee of success or profit when it comes to money.::Murray Walker
The lead car is unique, except for the one behind it which is identical.::Murray Walker
My government will respect the will of the people.::Mwai Kibaki
Leadership is a privilege to better the lives of others. It is not an opportunity to satisfy personal greed.::Mwai Kibaki
Silence and reserve will give anyone a reputation for wisdom.::Myrtle Reed
Loving a child doesn't mean giving in to all his whims to love him is to bring out the best in him, to teach him to love what is difficult.::Nadia Boulanger
Truth isn't always beauty, but the hunger for it is.::Nadine Gordimer
A child understands fear, and the hurt and hate it brings.::Nadine Gordimer
Power is something of which I am convinced there is no innocence this side of the womb.::Nadine Gordimer
Although you may spend your life killing, You will not exhaust all your foes. But if you quell your own anger, your real enemy will be slain.::Nagarjuna
If you desire ease, forsake learning.::Nagarjuna
Events at home, at work, in the street - these are the bases for a story.::Naguib Mahfouz
If we reject science, we reject the common man.::Naguib Mahfouz
God did not intend religion to be an exercise club.::Naguib Mahfouz
I wake up early in the morning and walk for an hour. If I have something to write, I prefer to write in the morning until midday, and in the afternoon, I eat.::Naguib Mahfouz
As the tension eases, we must look in the direction of agriculture, industry and education as our final goals, and toward democracy under Mr Mubarak.::Naguib Mahfouz
I believe society has a right to defend itself, just as the individual has the right to attack that with which he disagrees.::Naguib Mahfouz
There are no heroes in most of my stories. I look at our society with a critical eye and find nothing extraordinary in the people I see.::Naguib Mahfouz
History is full of people who went to prison or were burned at the stake for proclaiming their ideas. Society has always defended itself.::Naguib Mahfouz
I've never worked in politics, never been a member of an official committee or a political party.::Naguib Mahfouz
I was a government employee in the morning and a writer in the evening.::Naguib Mahfouz
Today's interpretations of religion are often backward and contradict the needs of civilization.::Naguib Mahfouz
I defend both the freedom of expression and society's right to counter it. I must pay the price for differing. It is the natural way of things.::Naguib Mahfouz
I love Sufism as I love beautiful poetry, but it is not the answer. Sufism is like a mirage in the desert. It says to you, come and sit, relax and enjoy yourself for a while.::Naguib Mahfouz
We are like a woman with a difficult pregnancy. We have to rebuild the social classes in Egypt, and we must change the way things were.::Naguib Mahfouz
If you want to move people, you look for a point of sensitivity, and in Egypt nothing moves people as much as religion.::Naguib Mahfouz
I accepted the interviews and encounters that had to be held with the media, but I would have preferred to work in peace.::Naguib Mahfouz
At my age it is unseemly to be pessimistic.::Naguib Mahfouz
Friendship's the privilege of private men for wretched greatness knows no blessing so substantial.::Nahum Tate
Skin has become inadequate in interfacing with reality. Technology has become the body's new membrane of existence.::Nam June Paik
If I was sad or afraid, I would sit in a corner and sing. If I was happy I would jump into the middle of the room and sing. It was how I expressed my emotions.::Nana Mouskouri
For my convalescence, I had to exercise my voice only with vowels. It is a medical rule after a long loss of voice.::Nana Mouskouri
My friends gave me the first songs which was the first food in my soul for me.::Nana Mouskouri
I do believe that if you haven't learnt about sadness, you cannot appreciate happiness.::Nana Mouskouri
Because society would rather we always wore a pretty face, women have been trained to cut off anger.::Nancy Friday
Now science has presented us with a hope called stem cell research, which may provide our scientists with many answers that have for so long been beyond our grasp.::Nancy Reagan

The movies were custard compared to politics.::Nancy Reagan
I believe that people would be alive today if there were a death penalty.::Nancy Reagan

Wise men, when in doubt whether to speak or to keep quiet, give themselves the benefit of the doubt, and remain silent.::Napoleon Hill
Action is the real measure of intelligence.::Napoleon Hill
We begin to see, therefore, the importance of selecting our environment with the greatest of care, because environment is the mental feeding ground out of which the food that goes into our minds is extracted.::Napoleon Hill
Every person who wins in any undertaking must be willing to cut all sources of retreat. Only by doing so can one be sure of maintaining that state of mind known as a burning desire to win - essential to success.::Napoleon Hill
Nature cannot be tricked or cheated. She will give up to you the object of your struggles only after you have paid her price.::Napoleon Hill
You might well remember that nothing can bring you success but yourself.::Napoleon Hill
The ladder of success is never crowded at the top.::Napoleon Hill
Don't wait. The time will never be just right.::Napoleon Hill

It takes half your life before you discover life is a do-it-yourself project.::Napoleon Hill
It has always been my belief that a man should do his best, regardless of how much he receives for his services, or the number of people he may be serving or the class of people served.::Napoleon Hill
Success in its highest and noblest form calls for peace of mind and enjoyment and happiness which come only to the man who has found the work that he likes best.::Napoleon Hill

If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way.::Napoleon Hill
War grows out of the desire of the individual to gain advantage at the expense of his fellow man.::Napoleon Hill
Every adversity, every failure, every heartache carries with it the seed on an equal or greater benefit.::Napoleon Hill
Strength and growth come only through continuous effort and struggle.::Napoleon Hill
Desire is the starting point of all achievement, not a hope, not a wish, but a keen pulsating desire which transcends everything.::Napoleon Hill
Happiness is found in doing, not merely possessing.::Napoleon Hill
First comes thought then organization of that thought, into ideas and plans then transformation of those plans into reality. The beginning, as you will observe, is in your imagination.::Napoleon Hill
Money without brains is always dangerous.::Napoleon Hill
The starting point of all achievement is desire.::Napoleon Hill
Great achievement is usually born of great sacrifice, and is never the result of selfishness.::Napoleon Hill

The time I trust will come, perhaps within the lives of some of us, when the outline of this science will be clearly made out and generally recognised, when its nomenclature will be fixed, and its principles form a part of elementary instruction.::Nassau William Senior
The whites come to applaud a Negro performer just like the colored do. When you've got the respect of white and colored, you can ease a lot of things.::Nat King Cole
Only time, education and plenty of good schooling will make anti-segregation work.::Nat King Cole
Music is emotional, and you may catch a musician in a very unemotional mood or you may not be in the same frame of mind as the musician. So a critic will often say a musician is slipping.::Nat King Cole

Our most intimate friend is not he to whom we show the worst, but the best of our nature.::Nathaniel Hawthorne
Nobody, I think, ought to read poetry, or look at pictures or statues, who cannot find a great deal more in them than the poet or artist has actually expressed. Their highest merit is suggestiveness.::Nathaniel Hawthorne
Every individual has a place to fill in the world and is important in some respect whether he chooses to be so or not.::Nathaniel Hawthorne
The only sensible ends of literature are, first, the pleasurable toil of writing second, the gratification of one's family and friends and lastly, the solid cash.::Nathaniel Hawthorne
We sometimes congratulate ourselves at the moment of waking from a troubled dream it may be so the moment after death.::Nathaniel Hawthorne

If that's there, I believe that technology will probably step up to their part of it.::Neil Armstrong
Research is creating new knowledge.::Neil Armstrong
NASA has been one of the most successful public investments in motivating students to do well and achieve all they can achieve. It's sad that we are turning the programme in a direction where it will reduce the amount of motivation and stimulation it provides to young people.::Neil Armstrong
Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon. July 1969 AD. We came in peace for all mankind.::Neil Armstrong
Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next 10.::Neil Armstrong
This is one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.::Neil Armstrong
All in all, for someone who was immersed in, fascinated by, and dedicated to flight, I was disappointed by the wrinkle in history that had brought me along one generation late. I had missed all the great times and adventures in flight.::Neil Armstrong
I'm substantially concerned about the policy directions of the space agency. We have a situation in the U.S. where the White House and Congress are at odds over what the future direction should be. They're sort of playing a game and NASA is the shuttlecock that they're hitting back and forth.::Neil Armstrong
I guess we all like to be recognized not for one piece of fireworks, but for the ledger of our daily work.::Neil Armstrong
The one thing I regret was that my work required an enormous amount of my time, and a lot of travel.::Neil Armstrong
In much of society, research means to investigate something you do not know or understand.::Neil Armstrong
We had a military and political leadership at that period which was genuinely deluded.::Neil Sheehan
Americans, particularly after World War II, tended to romanticize war because in World War II our cause was the cause of humanity, and our soldiers brought home glory and victory, and thank God that they did. But it led us to romanticize it to some extent.::Neil Sheehan
Just because you put higher-octane gasoline in your car doesn't mean you can break the speed limit. The speed limit's still 65.::Neil Sheehan
World War II had been such a tremendous success story for this country that the political and military leadership began to assume that they would prevail simply because of who they were. We were like the British at the turn of the 19th century.::Neil Sheehan
Sudden money is going from zero to two hundred dollars a week. The rest doesn't count.::Neil Simon
Take care of him. And make him feel important. And if you can do that, you'll have a happy and wonderful marriage. Like two out of every ten couples.::Neil Simon
Money brings some happiness. But after a certain point, it just brings more money.::Neil Simon
You must realize that honorary degrees are given generally to people whose SAT scores were too low to get them into schools the regular way. As a matter of fact, it was my SAT scores that led me into my present vocation in life, comedy.::Neil Simon
Sports is the only entertainment where, no matter how many times you go back, you never know the ending.::Neil Simon
How can a doctor judge a woman's sanity by merely bidding her good morning and refusing to hear her pleas for release? Even the sick ones know it is useless to say anything, for the answer will be that it is their imagination.::Nellie Bly
It is only after one is in trouble that one realizes how little sympathy and kindness there are in the world.::Nellie Bly
In our short walks we passed the kitchen where food was prepared for the nurses and doctors. There we got glimpses of melons and grapes and all kinds of fruits, beautiful white bread and nice meats, and the hungry feeling would be increased tenfold.::Nellie Bly
If the graves of the thousands of victims who have fallen in the terrible wars of the two races had been placed in line the philanthropist might travel from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from the Lakes to the Gulf, and be constantly in sight of green mounds.::Nelson A. Miles
Never play cards with a man called Doc. Never eat at a place called Mom's. Never sleep with a woman whose troubles are worse than your own.::Nelson Algren
Literature is made upon any occasion that a challenge is put to the legal apparatus by conscience in touch with humanity.::Nelson Algren
Coming to understand a painting or a symphony in an unfamiliar style, to recognize the work of an artist or school, to see or hear in new ways, is as cognitive an achievement as learning to read or write or add.::Nelson Goodman
Let there be work, bread, water and salt for all.::Nelson Mandela
I have retired, but if there's anything that would kill me it is to wake up in the morning not knowing what to do.::Nelson Mandela
I dream of an Africa which is in peace with itself.::Nelson Mandela
If there are dreams about a beautiful South Africa, there are also roads that lead to their goal. Two of these roads could be named Goodness and Forgiveness.::Nelson Mandela
Give a child love, laughter and peace, not AIDS.::Nelson Mandela
There are many people who feel that it is useless and futile to continue talking about peace and non-violence against a government whose only reply is savage attacks on an unarmed and defenceless people.::Nelson Mandela
I really wanted to retire and rest and spend more time with my children, my grandchildren and of course with my wife.::Nelson Mandela
Does anybody really think that they didn't get what they had because they didn't have the talent or the strength or the endurance or the commitment?::Nelson Mandela
Our human compassion binds us the one to the other - not in pity or patronizingly, but as human beings who have learnt how to turn our common suffering into hope for the future.::Nelson Mandela
I am confident that nobody... will accuse me of selfishness if I ask to spend time, while I am still in good health, with my family, my friends and also with myself.::Nelson Mandela
I started to make a study of the art of war and revolution and, whilst abroad, underwent a course in military training. If there was to be guerrilla warfare, I wanted to be able to stand and fight with my people and to share the hazards of war with them.::Nelson Mandela
Our single most important challenge is therefore to help establish a social order in which the freedom of the individual will truly mean the freedom of the individual.::Nelson Mandela
There is no easy walk to freedom anywhere, and many of us will have to pass through the valley of the shadow of death again and again before we reach the mountaintop of our desires.::Nelson Mandela
Only free men can negotiate prisoners cannot enter into contracts. Your freedom and mine cannot be separated.::Nelson Mandela
Communists have always played an active role in the fight by colonial countries for their freedom, because the short-term objects of Communism would always correspond with the long-term objects of freedom movements.::Nelson Mandela
There is no such thing as part freedom.::Nelson Mandela
Where globalization means, as it so often does, that the rich and powerful now have new means to further enrich and empower themselves at the cost of the poorer and weaker, we have a responsibility to protest in the name of universal freedom.::Nelson Mandela
There is nothing I fear more than waking up without a program that will help me bring a little happiness to those with no resources, those who are poor, illiterate, and ridden with terminal disease.::Nelson Mandela
I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.::Nelson Mandela
Let freedom reign. The sun never set on so glorious a human achievement.::Nelson Mandela
I dream of the realization of the unity of Africa, whereby its leaders combine in their efforts to solve the problems of this continent. I dream of our vast deserts, of our forests, of all our great wildernesses.::Nelson Mandela
Only free men can negotiate. A prisoner cannot enter into contracts.::Nelson Mandela
Intervention only works when the people concerned seem to be keen for peace.::Nelson Mandela
I should tie myself to no particular system of society other than of socialism.::Nelson Mandela
Nonviolence is a good policy when the conditions permit.::Nelson Mandela
Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.::Nelson Mandela
Courageous people do not fear forgiving, for the sake of peace.::Nelson Mandela
We must use time wisely and forever realize that the time is always ripe to do right.::Nelson Mandela
For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others.::Nelson Mandela
After climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb.::Nelson Mandela
I made a mistake by being ejected from the presidency. Next time, I will choose a Cabinet which will allow me to be life President.::Nelson Mandela
There is no passion to be found playing small - in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living.::Nelson Mandela
A good leader can engage in a debate frankly and thoroughly, knowing that at the end he and the other side must be closer, and thus emerge stronger. You don't have that idea when you are arrogant, superficial, and uninformed.::Nelson Mandela
If you want to make peace with your enemy, you have to work with your enemy. Then he becomes your partner.::Nelson Mandela
A good head and a good heart are always a formidable combination.::Nelson Mandela
I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities.::Nelson Mandela
I do not deny that I planned sabotage. I did not plan it in a spirit of recklessness nor because I have any love of violence. I planned it as a result of a calm and sober assessment of the political situation that had arisen after many years of tyranny, exploitation and oppression of my people by the whites.::Nelson Mandela
Never, never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by another.::Nelson Mandela
Forget the past.::Nelson Mandela
If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart.::Nelson Mandela
Money won't create success, the freedom to make it will.::Nelson Mandela
Sometimes, I feel like one who is on the sidelines, who has missed life itself.::Nelson Mandela
If the United States of America or Britain is having elections, they don't ask for observers from Africa or from Asia. But when we have elections, they want observers.::Nelson Mandela
There can be no keener revelation of a society's soul than the way in which it treats its children.::Nelson Mandela
It is better to lead from behind and to put others in front, especially when you celebrate victory when nice things occur. You take the front line when there is danger. Then people will appreciate your leadership.::Nelson Mandela
The secret to success is to own nothing, but control everything.::Nelson Rockefeller
Never forget that the most powerful force on earth is love.::Nelson Rockefeller
In war, whichever side may call itself the victor, there are no winners, but all are losers.::Neville Chamberlain
I believe it is peace in our time.::Neville Chamberlain
We would fight not for the political future of a distant city, rather for principles whose destruction would ruin the possibility of peace and security for the peoples of the earth.::Neville Chamberlain
We should seek by all means in our power to avoid war, by analysing possible causes, by trying to remove them, by discussion in a spirit of collaboration and good will.::Neville Chamberlain
However much we may sympathize with a small nation confronted by a big and powerful neighbours, we cannot in all circumstances undertake to involve the whole British Empire in a war simply on her account.::Neville Chamberlain
If we perform the romantic repertoire we need more musicians.::Neville Marriner
I think anybody with any intelligence sits down and sees Star Trek not a kids' show.::Nichelle Nichols
After these three novels I gave up writing novels for a time I was dissatisfied with romantic doom, yet didn't see much way around it.::Nicholas Mosley
It is impossible to exaggerate the wide, and widening, gulf between the American attitude on the Iraq war and the view from our friends across the Atlantic.::Nick Clooney
Respect and affection for animals, particularly those who share our homes, recognize no geographic borders.::Nick Clooney
The quality that defines us as Americans is the courage to respond to being hit. The courage to root out and destroy the killers. And, most importantly, the courage to hold on to our values and protect our hard-won freedoms while doing it.::Nick Clooney
One of the pleasant duties of America's most famous announcers during the relatively short swing era of the big bands was to host late-night remotes from some of the most famous ballrooms throughout the country.::Nick Clooney
Conventional wisdom holds that setting a timetable for getting American troops out of Iraq would be a mistake.::Nick Clooney
What the F.D.I.C. does is to put the full faith and credit of the United States government behind every savings account in the nation, up to a limit that has changed over the years and stands now at $100,000.::Nick Clooney
Preoccupation with money is the great test of small natures, but only a small test of great ones.::Nicolas Chamfort
Love is more pleasant than marriage for the same reason that novels are more amusing than history.::Nicolas Chamfort
Man arrives as a novice at each age of his life.::Nicolas Chamfort
Society is composed of two great classes those who have more dinners than appetite, and those who have more appetite than dinners.::Nicolas Chamfort
Living is a sickness to which sleep provides relief every sixteen hours. It's a palliative. The remedy is death.::Nicolas Chamfort
If it were not for the government, we should have nothing to laugh at in France.::Nicolas Chamfort
Swallow a toad in the morning and you will encounter nothing more disgusting the rest of the day.::Nicolas Chamfort
Change of fashion is the tax levied by the industry of the poor on the vanity of the rich.::Nicolas Chamfort
One must not hope to be more than one can be.::Nicolas Chamfort
When a man and a woman have an overwhelming passion for each other, it seems to me, in spite of such obstacles dividing them as parents or husband, that they belong to each other in the name of Nature, and are lovers by Divine right, in spite of human convention or the laws.::Nicolas Chamfort
It is commonly supposed that the art of pleasing is a wonderful aid in the pursuit of fortune but the art of being bored is infinitely more successful.::Nicolas Chamfort
The art of the parenthesis is one of the greatest secrets of eloquence in Society.::Nicolas Chamfort
Most of those who make collections of verse or epigram are like men eating cherries or oysters: they choose out the best at first, and end by eating all.::Nicolas Chamfort
Nature never said to me: Do not be poor still less did she say: Be rich her cry to me was always: Be independent.::Nicolas Chamfort
Do not fear lest you should meditate too much upon Him and speak of Him in an unworthy way, providing you are led by faith. Do not fear lest you should entertain false opinions of Him so long as they are in conformity with the notion of the infinitely perfect Being.::Nicolas Malebranche
In this connection, faith and experience teach us many truths by means of the short-cut of authority and by the proofs of very pleasant and agreeable feelings.::Nicolas Malebranche
God joins us together by means of the body, in consequence of the laws of the communication of movements. He affects us with the same feelings in consequence of the laws of the conjunction of body and soul.::Nicolas Malebranche
Movies are not scripts - movies are films they're not books, they're not the theatre.::Nicolas Roeg
And later I thought, I can't think how anyone can become a director without learning the craft of cinematography.::Nicolas Roeg
For it is the duty of an astronomer to compose the history of the celestial motions through careful and expert study.::Nicolaus Copernicus
Therefore, when I considered this carefully, the contempt which I had to fear because of the novelty and apparent absurdity of my view, nearly induced me to abandon utterly the work I had begun.::Nicolaus Copernicus
I am aware that a philosopher's ideas are not subject to the judgment of ordinary persons, because it is his endeavour to seek the truth in all things, to the extent permitted to human reason by God.::Nicolaus Copernicus
Although all the good arts serve to draw man's mind away from vices and lead it toward better things, this function can be more fully performed by this art, which also provides extraordinary intellectual pleasure.::Nicolaus Copernicus
So far as hypotheses are concerned, let no one expect anything certain from astronomy, which cannot furnish it, lest he accept as the truth ideas conceived for another purpose, and depart from this study a greater fool than when he entered it.::Nicolaus Copernicus
To know that we know what we know, and to know that we do not know what we do not know, that is true knowledge.::Nicolaus Copernicus
Not a few other very eminent and scholarly men made the same request, urging that I should no longer through fear refuse to give out my work for the common benefit of students of Mathematics.::Nicolaus Copernicus
So, influenced by these advisors and this hope, I have at length allowed my friends to publish the work, as they had long besought me to do.::Nicolaus Copernicus
It is wrong to think that the task of physics is to find out how Nature is. Physics concerns what we say about Nature.::Niels Bohr
Prediction is very difficult, especially if it's about the future.::Niels Bohr
There are trivial truths and the great truths. The opposite of a trivial truth is plainly false. The opposite of a great truth is also true.::Niels Bohr
Technology has advanced more in the last thirty years than in the previous two thousand. The exponential increase in advancement will only continue. Anthropological Commentary The opposite of a trivial truth is false the opposite of a great truth is also true.::Niels Bohr
The opposite of a fact is falsehood, but the opposite of one profound truth may very well be another profound truth.::Niels Bohr
How wonderful that we have met with a paradox. Now we have some hope of making progress.::Niels Bohr
The best weapon of a dictatorship is secrecy, but the best weapon of a democracy should be the weapon of openness.::Niels Bohr
Your theory is crazy, but it's not crazy enough to be true.::Niels Bohr
When it comes to atoms, language can be used only as in poetry. The poet, too, is not nearly so concerned with describing facts as with creating images.::Niels Bohr
Einstein, stop telling God what to do!::Niels Bohr
Every great and deep difficulty bears in itself its own solution. It forces us to change our thinking in order to find it.::Niels Bohr
All stories should have some honesty and truth in them, otherwise you're just playing about.::Nigel Kneale
Whether you like it or not, history is on our side. We will bury you!::Nikita Khrushchev
Don't you have a machine that puts food into the mouth and pushes it down?::Nikita Khrushchev
Support by United States rulers is rather in the nature of the support that the rope gives to a hanged man.::Nikita Khrushchev
Economics is a subject that does not greatly respect one's wishes.::Nikita Khrushchev
The more bombers, the less room for doves of peace.::Nikita Khrushchev
A good designer must rely on experience, on precise, logic thinking and on pedantic exactness. No magic will do.::Niklaus Wirth
But active programming consists of the design of new programs, rather than contemplation of old programs.::Niklaus Wirth
In the practical world of computing, it is rather uncommon that a program, once it performs correctly and satisfactorily, remains unchanged forever.::Niklaus Wirth
My being a teacher had a decisive influence on making language and systems as simple as possible so that in my teaching, I could concentrate on the essential issues of programming rather than on details of language and notation.::Niklaus Wirth
Nevertheless, I consider OOP as an aspect of programming in the large that is, as an aspect that logically follows programming in the small and requires sound knowledge of procedural programming.::Niklaus Wirth
My duty as a teacher is to train, educate future programmers.::Niklaus Wirth
Clearly, programming courses should teach methods of design and construction, and the selected examples should be such that a gradual development can be nicely demonstrated.::Niklaus Wirth
Let the future tell the truth, and evaluate each one according to his work and accomplishments. The present is theirs the future, for which I have really worked, is mine.::Nikola Tesla
I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success... such emotions make a man forget food, sleep, friends, love, everything.::Nikola Tesla
The spread of civilisation may be likened to a fire first, a feeble spark, next a flickering flame, then a mighty blaze, ever increasing in speed and power.::Nikola Tesla
There is a tragic clash between Truth and the world. Pure undistorted truth burns up the world.::Nikolai Berdyaev
Always think of what is useful and not what is beautiful. Beauty will come of its own accord.::Nikolai Gogol
We ought to thank God for that. Yes, the man who tills the land is more worthy of respect than any.::Nikolai Gogol
I said to the almond tree, 'Friend, speak to me of God,' and the almond tree blossomed.::Nikos Kazantzakis
I expect nothing. I fear no one. I am free.::Nikos Kazantzakis
I hope for nothing. I fear nothing. I am free.::Nikos Kazantzakis
Beauty is merciless. You do not look at it, it looks at you and does not forgive.::Nikos Kazantzakis
Every perfect traveler always creates the country where he travels.::Nikos Kazantzakis
In order to succeed, we must first believe that we can.::Nikos Kazantzakis
Since we cannot change reality, let us change the eyes which see reality.::Nikos Kazantzakis
People who don't read seem to me mysterious. I don't know how they think or learn about other people. Novels are a very important part of our education.::Nina Bawden
Ten thousand pounds is the legal value of a negligently taken life, of a child or a parent. A cold and somewhat mean-spirited calculation: you would do better if you slipped on a paving-stone and broke a front tooth.::Nina Bawden
I like writing for children. It seems to me that most people underestimate their understanding and the strength of their feelings and in my books for them I try to put this right.::Nina Bawden
I don't like rap music at all. I don't think it's music. It's just a beat and rapping.::Nina Simone
Once I understood Bach's music, I wanted to be a concert pianist. Bach made me dedicate my life to music, and it was that teacher who introduced me to his world.::Nina Simone
The worst thing about that kind of prejudice... is that while you feel hurt and angry and all the rest of it, it feeds you self-doubt. You start thinking, perhaps I am not good enough.::Nina Simone
I had spent many years pursuing excellence, because that is what classical music is all about... Now it was dedicated to freedom, and that was far more important.::Nina Simone
It is better we disintegrate in peace and not in pieces.::Nnamdi Azikiwe
It is the sincere desire of the writer that our citizens should early understand that the genuine source of correct republican principles is the bible, particularly the New Testament or the Christian religion.::Noah Webster
No truth is more evident to my mind than that the Christian religion must be the basis of any government intended to secure the rights and privileges of a free people.::Noah Webster
All the miseries and evils which men suffer from vice, crime, ambition, injustice, oppression, slavery and war, proceed from their despising or neglecting the precepts contained in the Bible.::Noah Webster
The Bible must be considered as the great source of all the truth by which men are to be guided in government as well as in all social transactions.::Noah Webster
When a citizen gives his suffrage to a man of known immorality he abuses his trust he sacrifices not only his own interest, but that of his neighbor he betrays the interest of his country.::Noah Webster
In my view, the Christian religion is the most important and one of the first things in which all children, under a free government ought to be instructed.::Noah Webster
Wanton killing of innocent civilians is terrorism, not a war against terrorism.::Noam Chomsky
I am opposed to the accumulation of executive power anywhere.::Noam Chomsky
The intellectual tradition is one of servility to power, and if I didn't betray it I'd be ashamed of myself.::Noam Chomsky
The internet could be a very positive step towards education, organisation and participation in a meaningful society.::Noam Chomsky
In the US, there is basically one party - the business party. It has two factions, called Democrats and Republicans, which are somewhat different but carry out variations on the same policies. By and large, I am opposed to those policies. As is most of the population.::Noam Chomsky
In many respects, the United States is a great country. Freedom of speech is protected more than in any other country. It is also a very free society.::Noam Chomsky
There are two problems for our species' survival - nuclear war and environmental catastrophe - and we're hurtling towards them. Knowingly.::Noam Chomsky
If we don't believe in freedom of expression for people we despise, we don't believe in it at all.::Noam Chomsky
Humans have certain properties and characteristics which are intrinsic to them, just as every other organism does. That's human nature.::Noam Chomsky
I remember at the age of five travelling on a trolley car with my mother past a group of women on a picket line at a textile plant, seeing them being viciously beaten by security people. So that kind of thing stayed with me.::Noam Chomsky
If there was an observer on Mars, they would probably be amazed that we have survived this long.::Noam Chomsky
The major advances in speed of communication and ability to interact took place more than a century ago. The shift from sailing ships to telegraph was far more radical than that from telephone to email!::Noam Chomsky
In this possibly terminal phase of human existence, democracy and freedom are more than just ideals to be valued - they may be essential to survival.::Noam Chomsky
We can, for example, be fairly confident that either there will be a world without war or there won't be a world - at least, a world inhabited by creatures other than bacteria and beetles, with some scattering of others.::Noam Chomsky
In the literal sense, there has been no relevant evolution since the trek from Africa. But there has been substantial progress towards higher standards of rights, justice and freedom - along with all too many illustrations of how remote is the goal of a decent society.::Noam Chomsky
The more you can increase fear of drugs and crime, welfare mothers, immigrants and aliens, the more you control all the people.::Noam Chomsky
The principle that human nature, in its psychological aspects, is nothing more than a product of history and given social relations removes all barriers to coercion and manipulation by the powerful.::Noam Chomsky
In the late 1990s, some of the worst terrorist atrocities in the world were what the Turkish government itself called state terror, namely massive atrocities, 80 percent of the arms coming from the United States, millions of refugees, tens of thousands of people killed, hideous repression, that's international terror, and we can go on and on.::Noam Chomsky
The only justification for repressive institutions is material and cultural deficit. But such institutions, at certain stages of history, perpetuate and produce such a deficit, and even threaten human survival.::Noam Chomsky
The public is not to see where power lies, how it shapes policy, and for what ends. Rather, people are to hate and fear one another.::Noam Chomsky
The government of Israel doesn't like the kinds of things I say, which puts them into the same category as every other government in the world.::Noam Chomsky
If you are working 50 hours a week in a factory, you don't have time to read 10 newspapers a day and go back to declassified government archives. But such people may have far-reaching insights into the way the world works.::Noam Chomsky
The Bible is one of the most genocidal books in history.::Noam Chomsky
Concentration of executive power, unless it's very temporary and for specific circumstances, let's say fighting world war two, it's an assault on democracy.::Noam Chomsky
Education must provide the opportunities for self-fulfillment it can at best provide a rich and challenging environment for the individual to explore, in his own way.::Noam Chomsky
Resistance is feasible even for those who are not heroes by nature, and it is an obligation, I believe, for those who fear the consequences and detest the reality of the attempt to impose American hegemony.::Noam Chomsky
Censorship is never over for those who have experienced it. It is a brand on the imagination that affects the individual who has suffered it, forever.::Noam Chomsky
The 'anti-globalisation movement' is the most significant proponent of globalisation - but in the interests of people, not concentrations of state-private power.::Noam Chomsky
Real popular culture is folk art - coalminers' songs and so forth.::Noam Chomsky
As soon as questions of will or decision or reason or choice of action arise, human science is at a loss.::Noam Chomsky
I was the first spokesperson for the Better Hearing Institute in Washington. And that's the message we tried to send out - there is hearing help out there, and the technology and options are amazing.::Norm Crosby
I get whatever placidity I have from my father. But my mother taught me how to take it on the chin.::Norma Shearer
Therefore I feel that the aforementioned guiding principle must be modified to read: If you desire peace, cultivate justice, but at the same time cultivate the fields to produce more bread otherwise there will be no peace.::Norman Borlaug
Man seems to insist on ignoring the lessons available from history.::Norman Borlaug
Man's survival, from the time of Adam and Eve until the invention of agriculture, must have been precarious because of his inability to ensure his food supply.::Norman Borlaug
Nevertheless, the number of farmers, small as well as large, who are adopting the new seeds and new technology is increasing very rapidly, and the increase in numbers during the past three years has been phenomenal.::Norman Borlaug
I am but one member of a vast team made up of many organizations, officials, thousands of scientists, and millions of farmers - mostly small and humble - who for many years have been fighting a quiet, oftentimes losing war on the food production front.::Norman Borlaug
Without food, man can live at most but a few weeks without it, all other components of social justice are meaningless.::Norman Borlaug
For, behind the scenes, halfway around the world in Mexico, were two decades of aggressive research on wheat that not only enabled Mexico to become self-sufficient with respect to wheat production but also paved the way to rapid increase in its production in other countries.::Norman Borlaug
Yet food is something that is taken for granted by most world leaders despite the fact that more than half of the population of the world is hungry.::Norman Borlaug
Food is the moral right of all who are born into this world.::Norman Borlaug
Civilization as it is known today could not have evolved, nor can it survive, without an adequate food supply.::Norman Borlaug
Almost certainly, however, the first essential component of social justice is adequate food for all mankind.::Norman Borlaug
Death is not the greatest loss in life. The greatest loss is what dies inside us while we live.::Norman Cousins
Wisdom consists of the anticipation of consequences.::Norman Cousins
A library, to modify the famous metaphor of Socrates, should be the delivery room for the birth of ideas - a place where history comes to life.::Norman Cousins
Government in the U.S. today is a senior partner in every business in the country.::Norman Cousins
A library is the delivery room for the birth of ideas, a place where history comes to life.::Norman Cousins
History is a vast early warning system.::Norman Cousins
The tragedy of life is in what dies inside a man while he lives - the death of genuine feeling, the death of inspired response, the awareness that makes it possible to feel the pain or the glory of other men in yourself.::Norman Cousins
People are never more insecure than when they become obsessed with their fears at the expense of their dreams.::Norman Cousins
Man is not imprisoned by habit. Great changes in him can be wrought by crisis - once that crisis can be recognized and understood.::Norman Cousins
The capacity for hope is the most significant fact of life. It provides human beings with a sense of destination and the energy to get started.::Norman Cousins
It makes little difference how many university courses or degrees a person may own. If he cannot use words to move an idea from one point to another, his education is incomplete.::Norman Cousins
It is reasonable to expect the doctor to recognize that science may not have all the answers to problems of health and healing.::Norman Cousins
My reason nourishes my faith and my faith my reason.::Norman Cousins
The main failure of education is that it has not prepared people to comprehend matters concerning human destiny.::Norman Cousins
Life is an adventure in forgiveness.::Norman Cousins
The human body experiences a powerful gravitational pull in the direction of hope. That is why the patient's hopes are the physician's secret weapon. They are the hidden ingredients in any prescription.::Norman Cousins
We will not have peace by afterthought.::Norman Cousins
Hope is independent of the apparatus of logic.::Norman Cousins
Respect for the fragility and importance of an individual life is still the mark of an educated man.::Norman Cousins
He who keeps his cool best wins.::Norman Cousins
The sublimity of wisdom is to do those things living, which are to be desired when dying.::Norman Douglas
There is in us a lyric germ or nucleus which deserves respect it bids a man to ponder or create and in this dim corner of himself he can take refuge and find consolations which the society of his fellow creatures does not provide.::Norman Douglas
The pine stays green in winter... wisdom in hardship.::Norman Douglas
What is all wisdom save a collection of platitudes?::Norman Douglas
A man can believe a considerable deal of rubbish, and yet go about his daily work in a rational and cheerful manner.::Norman Douglas
Shall I give you my recipe for happiness? I find everything useful and nothing indispensable. I find everything wonderful and nothing miraculous. I reverence the body. I avoid first causes like the plague.::Norman Douglas
Education is a state-controlled manufactory of echoes.::Norman Douglas
You can construct the character of a man and his age not only from what he does and says, but from what he fails to say and do.::Norman Douglas
I find myself more at peace when I live in Europe.::Norman Granz
Moonstruck... was one of the few romantic comedies to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar.::Norman Jewison
And even Moonstruck - for some reason the audience were just in the mood for a very romantic film, because it's one of the few romantic comedies to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar.::Norman Jewison
Everything Sholom Aleichem talks about in his plays and his short stories is about people, family, man's relationship with his God, the breaking down of tradition.::Norman Jewison
With most British actors, it's amazing. I think they start with the character on the outside and work in.::Norman Jewison
I'm in the mood for another Moonstruck experience, for another romantic comedy.::Norman Jewison
I showed that privacy was an implicit right in Jewish law, probably going back to the second or third century, when it was elaborated on in a legal way.::Norman Lamm
Modern Orthodoxy has a highly positive attitude toward the State of Israel. Our Ultra-Orthodox brethren recognize only the Holy Land, but not the state.::Norman Lamm
But you know, my dad called me the laziest white kid he ever met. When I screamed back at him that he was putting down a race of people to call me lazy, his answer was that's not what he was doing, and that I was also the dumbest white kid he ever met.::Norman Lear
I think the greater responsibility, in terms of morality, is where leadership begins.::Norman Lear
I guess because the shows were activist in their own way - the marriage of my public activism and my career activism, you know - people understand me very well. They also understand there's a very strong bipartisan part in all of this.::Norman Lear
In the area we're discussing, leadership begins on Madison Avenue, on the desks and in the offices of people who spend hundreds of millions of dollars buying what will get them ratings.::Norman Lear
Life is made up of small pleasures. Happiness is made up of those tiny successes. The big ones come too infrequently. And if you don't collect all these tiny successes, the big ones don't really mean anything.::Norman Lear
But it also became the experience, or was the experience, of the writers who were attracted to this kind of humor. They're all men or women who come from the same kind of experience in their own lives.::Norman Lear
In this nation, leadership is dollars.::Norman Lear
When I was asked to be Writer in Residence at Edinburgh I thought, you can't teach poetry. This is ridiculous.::Norman MacCaig
However, I learned something. I thought that if the young person, the student, has poetry in him or her, to offer them help is like offering a propeller to a bird.::Norman MacCaig

The only thing to do with good advice is to pass it on. It is never of any use to oneself.::Oscar Wilde
To expect the unexpected shows a thoroughly modern intellect.::Oscar Wilde

Memories are like mulligatawny soup in a cheap restaurant. It is best not to stir them.::P. G. Wodehouse

Sudden success in golf is like the sudden acquisition of wealth. It is apt to unsettle and deteriorate the character.::P. G. Wodehouse

The art of interpretation is not to play what is written.::Pablo Casals
Music is the divine way to tell beautiful, poetic things to the heart.::Pablo Casals
Each person has inside a basic decency and goodness. If he listens to it and acts on it, he is giving a great deal of what it is the world needs most. It is not complicated but it takes courage. It takes courage for a person to listen to his own goodness and act on it.::Pablo Casals
The love of one's country is a splendid thing. But why should love stop at the border?::Pablo Casals
I grew up in this town, my poetry was born between the hill and the river, it took its voice from the rain, and like the timber, it steeped itself in the forests.::Pablo Neruda
Peace goes into the making of a poem as flour goes into the making of bread.::Pablo Neruda

There is no abstract art. You must always start with something. Afterward you can remove all traces of reality.::Pablo Picasso
It takes a long time to become young.::Pablo Picasso
I am always doing that which I cannot do, in order that I may learn how to do it.::Pablo Picasso

Good artists copy, great artists steal.::Pablo Picasso
Computers are useless. They can only give you answers.::Pablo Picasso
I don't believe in accidents. There are only encounters in history. There are no accidents.::Pablo Picasso

I paint objects as I think them, not as I see them.::Pablo Picasso
What might be taken for a precocious genius is the genius of childhood. When the child grows up, it disappears without a trace. It may happen that this boy will become a real painter some day, or even a great painter. But then he will have to begin everything again, from zero.::Pablo Picasso
Art is not the application of a canon of beauty but what the instinct and the brain can conceive beyond any canon. When we love a woman we don't start measuring her limbs.::Pablo Picasso
Art is the elimination of the unnecessary.::Pablo Picasso
Love is the greatest refreshment in life.::Pablo Picasso
Art is the lie that enables us to realize the truth.::Pablo Picasso
My mother said to me, 'If you are a soldier, you will become a general. If you are a monk, you will become the Pope.' Instead, I was a painter, and became Picasso.::Pablo Picasso
We all know that Art is not truth. Art is a lie that makes us realize the truth, at least the truth that is given to us to understand.::Pablo Picasso
We must not discriminate between things. Where things are concerned there are no class distinctions. We must pick out what is good for us where we can find it.::Pablo Picasso
Some painters transform the sun into a yellow spot, others transform a yellow spot into the sun.::Pablo Picasso
To finish a work? To finish a picture? What nonsense! To finish it means to be through with it, to kill it, to rid it of its soul, to give it its final blow the coup de grace for the painter as well as for the picture.::Pablo Picasso
Never permit a dichotomy to rule your life, a dichotomy in which you hate what you do so you can have pleasure in your spare time. Look for a situation in which your work will give you as much happiness as your spare time.::Pablo Picasso
It is your work in life that is the ultimate seduction.::Pablo Picasso
If there were only one truth, you couldn't paint a hundred canvases on the same theme.::Pablo Picasso

Our goals can only be reached through a vehicle of a plan, in which we must fervently believe, and upon which we must vigorously act. There is no other route to success.::Pablo Picasso
Every positive value has its price in negative terms... the genius of Einstein leads to Hiroshima.::Pablo Picasso
The artist is a receptacle for emotions that come from all over the place: from the sky, from the earth, from a scrap of paper, from a passing shape, from a spider's web.::Pablo Picasso
Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life.::Pablo Picasso
The people who make art their business are mostly imposters.::Pablo Picasso

There are only two types of women - goddesses and doormats.::Pablo Picasso

It's always the generals with the bloodiest records who are the first to shout what a hell it is. And it's always the war widows who lead the Memorial Day parades.::Paddy Chayefsky
Artists don't talk about art. Artists talk about work. If I have anything to say to young writers, it's stop thinking of writing as art. Think of it as work.::Paddy Chayefsky
Medicine is not only a science it is also an art. It does not consist of compounding pills and plasters it deals with the very processes of life, which must be understood before they may be guided.::Paracelsus
Life is like music, it must be composed by ear, feeling and instinct, not by rule. Nevertheless one had better know the rules, for they sometimes guide in doubtful cases, though not often.::Paracelsus
Many have said of Alchemy, that it is for the making of gold and silver. For me such is not the aim, but to consider only what virtue and power may lie in medicines.::Paracelsus
Dreams are not without meaning wherever thay may come from-from fantasy, from the elements, or from other inspiration.::Paracelsus
The dreams which reveal the supernatural are promises and messages that God sends us directly: they are nothing but His angels, His ministering spirits , who usually appear to us when we are in a great predicament.::Paracelsus
Dreams must be heeded and accepted. For a great many of them come true.::Paracelsus
The interpretation of dreams is a great art.::Paracelsus
From time immemorial artistic insights have been revealed to artists in their sleep and in dreams, so that at all times they ardently desired them.::Paracelsus
The art of healing comes from nature, not from the physician. Therefore the physician must start from nature, with an open mind.::Paracelsus
However, anyone to whom this happens should not leave his room upon awakening, should speak to no-one, but remain alone and sober until everything comes back to him, and he recalls the dream.::Paracelsus
Once a disease has entered the body, all parts which are healthy must fight it: not one alone, but all. Because a disease might mean their common death. Nature knows this and Nature attacks the disease with whatever help she can muster.::Paracelsus
Let my soul smile through my heart and my heart smile through my eyes, that I may scatter rich smiles in sad hearts.::Paramahansa Yogananda
The happiness of one's own heart alone cannot satisfy the soul one must try to include, as necessary to one's own happiness, the happiness of others.::Paramahansa Yogananda
The man form is higher than the angel form of all forms it is the highest. Man is the highest being in creation, because he aspires to freedom.::Paramahansa Yogananda
Truth is exact correspondence with reality.::Paramahansa Yogananda
The season of failure is the best time for sowing the seeds of success.::Paramahansa Yogananda
There is a magnet in your heart that will attract true friends. That magnet is unselfishness, thinking of others first when you learn to live for others, they will live for you.::Paramahansa Yogananda
Ironically, for a few million people in the Far East, I did become an English teacher through my music.::Pat Boone
So obviously, any religion embodies some form of rules and expectations for behavior, and even sometimes consequences, and they don't want to hear any of that.::Pat Boone
Don't trust anyone over 30.::Pat Boone
In reality, serial killers are of average intelligence.::Pat Brown
While we are being fascinated by the tales of famous serial killers and how they were brought to justice, the real serial killer goes about his business with hardly a thought to being caught.::Pat Brown
The food that enters the mind must be watched as closely as the food that enters the body.::Pat Buchanan
I still have a young attitude.::Pat Morita
I can always see what I've done wrong. I'm always learning. I'm the perennial student.::Pat Oliphant
First, I have the privilege of being Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. It is not an oxymoron I assure you.::Pat Roberts
Feminism is a socialist, anti-family, political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism and become lesbians.::Pat Robertson
Feminism encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism and become lesbians.::Pat Robertson
The thought about Republicans is, we're supposed to be Jeffersonian. That government governs the best that governs the least.::Pat Robertson
It seems to me the Washington Monument is a symbol of America's power. It has been the symbol of our great nation. We look at the symbol and we say 'this is one nation under God.'::Pat Robertson
I mean, if a person acts irresponsibly in his own life, he will pay the consequences. And it's not so much divine retribution as it's built into the law of nature.::Pat Robertson
And it's one thing to give people freedom and something else to deny the rights of Christians to assert their faith in order to keep Hindus from feeling upset.::Pat Robertson
The truth is, the secular world isn't too enamored with Jesus. And they're not too enamored with someone who is leading people to Jesus. So if you're out there talking about people's sins, and you're talking about righteousness, you will get pushback. Jesus Himself did. The apostles did. I mean, there's persecution all up and down the line.::Pat Robertson
But if there's an erosion at home, you know, Thomas Jefferson warned about a tyranny of an oligarchy and if we surrender our democracy to the tyranny of an oligarchy, we've made a terrible mistake.::Pat Robertson
Jesus Christ is a prince of peace. He told us to live in peace. He told us to love our enemies. He told us to do good to them that spitefully use us.::Pat Robertson
Well, what was called the blessed hope of the Bible is that one day Jesus Christ would come back again, start a whole new era, that this world order that we know it would change into something that would be wonderful that we'd call the millennium.::Pat Robertson
The wisdom of God's Word is quite clear on believers being unequally yoked. And marrying someone who is not a Christian - who is not a daily disciple of Christ - is being unequally yoked, regardless of what their beliefs might be.::Pat Robertson
There's an assault on human sexuality, as Judge Scalia said, they've taken sides in the culture war and on top of that if we have a democracy, the democratic processes should be that we can elect representatives who will share our point of view and vote those things into law.::Pat Robertson
Islam is a violent, I was going to say religion, but it's not a religion. It's a political system. It's a violent political system bent on the overthrow of the governments of the world and world domination. That is the ultimate aim.::Pat Robertson
Anything's possible in politics.::Pat Robertson
The Supreme Court has insulted you over and over again, Lord. They've taken your Bible away from the schools. They've forbidden little children to pray. They've taken the knowledge of God as best they can, and organizations have come into court to take the knowledge of God out of the public square of America.::Pat Robertson
Is there in all the history of human folly a greater fool than a clergymen in politics?::Pat Robertson
I'm a person that just likes to speak the truth, and I don't understand why in America it's such a big deal that we won't read the Koran and we won't look at history.::Pat Robertson
There are times in history where a particular doctrine becomes a symbol of a greater problem.::Pat Robertson
There's no question that jihad historically means war.::Pat Robertson
If you read back in the Bible, the letter of the apostle Paul to the church of Thessalonia, he said that in the latter days before the end of the age that the Earth would be caught up in what he called the birth pangs of a new order.::Pat Robertson
God created the world the laws of nature were created by God. True science tries to find out what God put in the world. The trouble is where scientists speculate about theology and they don't know what they're talking about because they weren't there. They can't speculate about the origins of life because they weren't there.::Pat Robertson
Adoptive parents are taking on enormous responsibility, both emotionally and financially. Quite frankly, they need as much disclosure as possible about the child's background and health to assure the best fit and be prepared.::Pat Robertson
I think the Democrats are catering to them, but, you know, in the entire history of the United States of America, there has never been a judge who has been refused a vote when there was a majority of Senators willing to vote for his confirmation, never in history.::Pat Robertson
My imagination functions much better when I don't have to speak to people.::Patricia Highsmith
I have Graham Greene's telephone number, but I wouldn't dream of using it. I don't seek out writers because we all want to be alone.::Patricia Highsmith
Robert Walker as Bruno was excellent. He had elegance and humor, and the proper fondness for his mother.::Patricia Highsmith
For neither life nor nature cares if justice is ever done or not.::Patricia Highsmith
I only know it takes weeks to recover, as if one had been in a car accident.::Patricia Highsmith
When you call upon a Thoroughbred, he gives you all the speed, strength of heart and sinew in him. When you call on a jackass, he kicks.::Patricia Neal
A master can tell you what he expects of you. A teacher, though, awakens your own expectations.::Patricia Neal
A strong positive mental attitude will create more miracles than any wonder drug.::Patricia Neal
Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright force. Whenever you give up that force, you are inevitably ruined.::Patrick Henry
I know of no way of judging the future but by the past.::Patrick Henry
Is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death!::Patrick Henry

We are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the God of Nature has placed in our power... the battle, sir, is not to the strong alone it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave.::Patrick Henry
Give me liberty or give me death.::Patrick Henry
For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth to know the worst and provide for it.::Patrick Henry
I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that is the lamp of experience.::Patrick Henry
A man is original when he speaks the truth that has always been known to all good men.::Patrick Kavanagh
I think space will be conquered through the mind rather than the clumsy medium of space travel.::Patrick Troughton
Probably induced by the asthma, I started reading and writing early on, my literary efforts from the age of about nine running chiefly to poetry and plays.::Patrick White
My father and mother were second cousins, though they did not meet till shortly before their marriage.::Patrick White
I'm not gonna ride home in the car. I'll wait for Randy. I think I'll get home quicker.::Patsy Cline
I recorded a song called, I Fall to Pieces, and I was in a car wreck. Now I'm worried because I have a brand-new record, and it's called Crazy!::Patsy Cline
Boys, they can't take my refrigerator now. They'll never get my car now. I paid cash for 'em and they're mine, and I'm keepin' 'em!::Patsy Cline
If I made a list of the people I admire, Mom would probably fill up half of it. She could do anything and everything.::Patsy Cline
I would never have gone anywhere if it hadn't been for Mother's faith and support.::Patsy Cline
Always keep learning. It keeps you young.::Patty Berg
Novel technologies and ideas that impinge on human biology and their perceived impact on human values have renewed strains in the relationship between science and society.::Paul Berg
That work led to the emergence of the recombinant DNA technology thereby providing a major tool for analyzing mammalian gene structure and function and formed the basis for me receiving the 1980 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.::Paul Berg
Today, it is research with human embryonic stem cells and attempts to prepare cloned stem cells for research and medical therapies that are being disavowed as being ethically unacceptable.::Paul Berg
Modern societies march towards morality in proportion as they leave religion behind.::Paul Bert
Slowly but surely, we are acquiring that famous culture of democracy, which is our objective.::Paul Biya
Solitude is strength to depend on the presence of the crowd is weakness. The man who needs a mob to nerve him is much more alone than he imagines.::Paul Brunton
Worry is spiritual short sight. Its cure is intelligent faith.::Paul Brunton
Poetry is a sort of homecoming.::Paul Celan
Intelligence is nothing without delight.::Paul Claudel
Family trips to Yellowstone and to what are now national parks in Southern Utah, driving the primitive roads and cars of that day, were real adventures.::Paul D. Boyer
A painstaking course in qualitative and quantitative analysis by John Wing gave me an appreciation of the need for, and beauty of, accurate measurement.::Paul D. Boyer
An unexpected benefit of my career in biochemistry has been travel.::Paul D. Boyer
God used beautiful mathematics in creating the world.::Paul Dirac
I do not see how a man can work on the frontiers of physics and write poetry at the same time. They are in opposition.::Paul Dirac
In science one tries to tell people, in such a way as to be understood by everyone, something that no one ever knew before. But in poetry, it's the exact opposite.::Paul Dirac
I should like to suggest to you that the cause of all the economic troubles is that we have an economic system which tries to maintain an equality of value between two things, which it would be better to recognise from the beginning as of unequal value.::Paul Dirac

Art does not reproduce what we see rather, it makes us see.::Paul Klee

Design is everything. Everything!::Paul Rand
You want to shut up every Negro who has the courage to stand up and fight for the rights of his people, for the rights of workers, and I have been on many a picket line for the steelworkers too.::Paul Robeson
I know that if the peace movement takes its message boldly to the Negro people a powerful force can be secured in pursuit of the greatest goal of all mankind. And the same is true of labor and the great democratic sections of our population.::Paul Robeson
I said it was my feeling that the American people would struggle for peace, and that has since been underscored by the President of these United States.::Paul Robeson

The courage to be is rooted in the God who appears when God has disappeared in the anxiety of doubt.::Paul Tillich

Y'know, the real reason why I was such a failure in the sense of being unable to make any sort of a living was because I was really not motivated. I had no motivation.::Paul Twitchell
There is no teacher, living or past, who can give us the actual understanding of Truth. A teacher can only put our feet upon the path and point the way. That is all. It is wholly dependent on the individual to make his way to Truth.::Paul Twitchell
The higher one climbs on the spiritual ladder, the more they will grant others their own freedom, and give less interference to another's state of consciousness.::Paul Twitchell
Our spiritual attitude is determined by our conception of our relation to infinite spirit.::Paul Twitchell
Radical constructivism, thus, is radical because it breaks with convention and develops a theory of knowledge in which knowledge does not reflect an 'objective' ontological reality.::Paul Watzlawick
It is difficult to imagine how any behavior in the presence of another person can avoid being a communication of one's own view of the nature of one's relationship with that person and how it can fail to influence that person.::Paul Watzlawick

The way of peace is the way of love. Love is the greatest power on earth. It conquers all things.::Peace Pilgrim

I'm moving on. I should have made that clear when I made the announcement. I guess I wasn't clear. If people think you're leaving a show after all these years, you might be retiring.

I am trying to make clear through my writing something which I believe: that biography- history in general- can be literature in the deepest and highest sense of that term.::Robert Caro

If we were all determined to play the first violin we should never have an ensemble. therefore, respect every musician in his proper place.::Robert Schumann
To send light into the darkness of men's hearts - such is the duty of the artist.::Robert Schumann
Just as predatory animals follow a similar general design and behave in similar ways, so organizations, especially those in competition with one another, must follow certain design principles if they are to succeed and prevail.::Robert Shea
Ultimately we may still ask, why can't humans design a perfect society?::Robert Shea
To reject even one major tenet of the religion or to violate one major rule of behavior is enough to get one kicked out - or worse.::Robert Shea
It often happens that when a person possesses a particular ability to an extraordinary degree, nature makes up for it by leaving him or her incompetent in every other department.::Robert Shea
Organized religion provides a model of the way all organizations, from the state down to the village garden club, end a price in terms of a member's freedom of thought and action.::Robert Shea
One simple way to keep organizations from becoming cancerous might be to rotate all jobs on a regular, frequent and mandatory basis, including the leadership positions.::Robert Shea
The key element in tragedy is that heroes and heroines are destroyed by that which appears to be their greatest strength.::Robert Shea
When a finished work of 20th century sculpture is placed in an 18th century garden, it is absorbed by the ideal representation of the past, thus reinforcing political and social values that are no longer with us.::Robert Smithson
Instead of causing us to remember the past like the old monuments, the new monuments seem to cause us to forget the future.::Robert Smithson
Artists themselves are not confined, but their output is.::Robert Smithson
Painting, sculpture and architecture are finished, but the art habit continues.::Robert Smithson
The loss of a friend is like that of a limb time may heal the anguish of the wound, but the loss cannot be repaired.::Robert Southey
Order is the sanity of the mind, the health of the body, the peace of the city, the security of the state. Like beams in a house or bones to a body, so is order to all things.::Robert Southey
No distance of place or lapse of time can lessen the friendship of those who are thoroughly persuaded of each other's worth.::Robert Southey
A kitten is in the animal world what a rosebud is in the garden.::Robert Southey
Someone once accused me of being like Eliot Ness. I sad no sir, I'm not E.N., but I can promise you that I'm not Al Capone!::Robert Stack
A great chef is an artist that I truly respect.::Robert Stack
Friendship will not stand the strain of very much good advice for very long.::Robert Staughton Lynd

Knowledge is power only if man knows what facts not to bother with.::Robert Staughton Lynd
Cut quarrels out of literature, and you will have very little history or drama or fiction or epic poetry left.::Robert Staughton Lynd
There are some people who want to throw their arms round you simply because it is Christmas there are other people who want to strangle you simply because it is Christmas.::Robert Staughton Lynd
While only about half of the voters feel they know very much about Reagan or what he stands for, the Republicans who do have a very positive perception of him.::Robert Teeter
The President's political travel is going to get blamed (and probably rightly) for a share of this downturn.::Robert Teeter
The President has not created any Ford constituency, unique from that of any Republican President. The one exception to this is that he does show unique strength with young voters for a Republican.::Robert Teeter
Research has shown that the perceived style of leadership is by far the most important thing to most voters in evaluating officeholders and candidates.::Robert Teeter
Look at the declining television coverage. Look at the declining voting rate. Economics and economic news is what moves the country now, not politics.::Robert Teeter
Whatever he does should be seen as working at the Presidency and if he goes to Colorado for Christmas, it should be for a minimum amount of time, the family tradition and family get-together aspect emphasized, and it be seen as a working vacation.::Robert Teeter
I think we need one recognized, respected public figure to make a tough, blunt statement on just what Reagan's record is and what he might do to the country, let alone the Republican Party before Christmas.::Robert Teeter
This is easy to say with the benefit of hindsight, but I think it once again points out how very important style of leadership, that is the way he does what he does, is to his perception.::Robert Teeter
Without a Mayaguez, or something comparable that we don't see in the immediate future, there is probably no one thing the President can do to himself to turn this situation around.::Robert Teeter
Every person has only so much attention to give, and politics and government takes up only a fraction of what it did 25 years ago.::Robert Teeter
Many citizens see all the leadership of these large institutions together in a conspiracy against them rather than in any adversary relationship with each other.::Robert Teeter
We have not sought this conflict we have sought too long to avoid it our forbearance has been construed into weakness, our magnanimity into fear, until the vindication of our manhood, as well as the defence of our rights, is required at our hands.::Robert Toombs
The basis, the corner-stone of this Government, was the perfect equality of the free, sovereign, and independent States which made it.::Robert Toombs
Give us equality of enjoyment, equal right to expansion - it is as necessary to our prosperity as yours.::Robert Toombs
We fear doing too little when we should do more. Then atone by doing too much, when perhaps we should do less.::Robert Trout
Leibniz dedicated his life to efforts to educate people to understand that true happiness is found by locating their identity in benefitting mankind and their posterity.::Robert Trout
A successful society is characterized by a rising living standard for its population, increasing investment in factories and basic infrastructure, and the generation of additional surplus, which is invested in generating new discoveries in science and technology.::Robert Trout
You see, some non-Catholic friends of mine have questioned the depth of my faith because of the fact that I have a good education.::Robert Vaughn
Write verse, not poetry. The public wants verse. If you have a talent for poetry, then don't by any means mother it, but try your hand at verse.::Robert W. Service
No man can be a failure if he thinks he's a success If he thinks he is a winner, then he is.::Robert W. Service
The only society I like is rough and tough, and the tougher the better. There's where you get down to bedrock and meet human people.::Robert W. Service
I have an intense dislike for artificial society. In France, one could lead a free life - to do what one wanted to do without interference or criticism from one's neighbors.::Robert W. Service
A dog will teach you unconditional love. If you can have that in your life, things won't be too bad.::Robert Wagner
I love Joan Collins. She's a wonderful lady. She has such courage. She's such a good actress.::Robert Wagner
Gentlemen have talked a great deal of patriotism. A venerable word, when duly practiced.::Robert Walpole
The very idea of true patriotism is lost, and the term has been prostituted to the very worst of purposes. A patriot, sir! Why, patriots spring up like mushrooms!::Robert Walpole
I will not attempt to deny the reasonableness and necessity of a party war but in carrying on that war all principles and rules of justice should not be departed from.::Robert Walpole
There are two sorts of curiosity - the momentary and the permanent. The momentary is concerned with the odd appearance on the surface of things. The permanent is attracted by the amazing and consecutive life that flows on beneath the surface of things.::Robert Wilson Lynd
It is almost impossible to remember how tragic a place the world is when one is playing golf.::Robert Wilson Lynd
There is nothing in which the birds differ more from man than the way in which they can build and yet leave a landscape as it was before.::Robert Wilson Lynd
My three Ps: passion, patience, perseverance. You have to do this if you've got to be a filmmaker.::Robert Wise
My hope is that out of all the anger and seeming hostility that we hear in some of today's music will come some sort of coalition that will become politically involved.::Roberta Flack
Once you're successful with a certain kind of music, it's hard not to have faith in it as a means to stay successful.::Roberta Flack
Without forgiveness life is governed by... an endless cycle of resentment and retaliation.::Roberto Assagioli
A garden is a complex of aesthetic and plastic intentions and the plant is, to a landscape artist, not only a plant - rare, unusual, ordinary or doomed to disappearance - but it is also a color, a shape, a volume or an arabesque in itself.::Roberto Burle Marx
There is no nonsense so gross that society will not, at some time, make a doctrine of it and defend it with every weapon of communal stupidity.::Robertson Davies
The greatest gift that Oxford gives her sons is, I truly believe, a genial irreverence toward learning, and from that irreverence love may spring.::Robertson Davies
A truly great book should be read in youth, again in maturity and once more in old age, as a fine building should be seen by morning light, at noon and by moonlight.::Robertson Davies
Do not suppose, however, that I intend to urge a diet of classics on anybody. I have seen such diets at work. I have known people who have actually read all, or almost all, the guaranteed Hundred Best Books. God save us from reading nothing but the best.::Robertson Davies
Their very conservatism is secondhand, and they don't know what they are conserving.::Robertson Davies
The world is full of people whose notion of a satisfactory future is, in fact, a return to the idealised past.::Robertson Davies
The love of truth lies at the root of much humor.::Robertson Davies
The great book for you is the book that has the most to say to you at the moment when you are reading. I do not mean the book that is most instructive, but the book that feeds your spirit. And that depends on your age, your experience, your psychological and spiritual need.::Robertson Davies
I would think twice about designing stuff for which there was no need and which didn't endure.::Robin Day
Cruelty is a part of nature, at least of human nature, but it is the one thing that seems unnatural to us.::Robinson Jeffers
Imagination, the traitor of the mind, has taken my solitude and slain it.::Robinson Jeffers
Art must unquestionably have a social value that is, as a potential means of communication it must be addressed, and in comprehensible terms, to the understanding of mankind.::Rockwell Kent
In the ring, I never really knew fear.::Rocky Marciano
Cats have it all - admiration, an endless sleep, and company only when they want it.::Rod McKuen
Imagination... its limits are only those of the mind itself.::Rod Serling
There is a fifth dimension, beyond that which is known to man. It is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity. It is the middle ground between light and shadow, between science and superstition.::Rod Serling
I am a poor student sitting at the feet of giants, yearning for their wisdom and begging for lessons that might one day make me a complete artist, so that if all goes well, I may one day sit beside them.::Rod Taylor
I suddenly realized how much I loved her when we attended Alfred Hitchcock's 75th birthday party last August. There was something magical about that night, and it made me see how much she really meant to me.::Rod Taylor
I assure you that the training that you get in a midget, in a sprint car and perhaps in a Silver Crown car is really the kind of experience that makes you into a damn good race driver.::Rodger Ward
Indy makes the race driver. You become famous when you come here.::Rodger Ward
It's tough to stay married. My wife kisses the dog on the lips, yet she won't drink from my glass.::Rodney Dangerfield
My wife met me at the door the other night in a sexy negligee. Unfortunately, she was just coming home.::Rodney Dangerfield
I looked up my family tree and found three dogs using it.::Rodney Dangerfield
I'm at the age where food has taken the place of sex in my life. In fact, I've just had a mirror put over my kitchen table.::Rodney Dangerfield
I looked up my family tree and found out I was the sap.::Rodney Dangerfield
This morning when I put on my underwear I could hear the fruit-of-the-loom guys laughing at me.::Rodney Dangerfield
A girl phoned me the other day and said... 'Come on over, there's nobody home.' I went over. Nobody was home.::Rodney Dangerfield
Yeah, I know I'm ugly... I said to a bartender, 'Make me a zombie.' He said 'God beat me to it.'::Rodney Dangerfield
I drink too much. The last time I gave a urine sample it had an olive in it.::Rodney Dangerfield
I told my wife the truth. I told her I was seeing a psychiatrist. Then she told me the truth: that she was seeing a psychiatrist, two plumbers, and a bartender.::Rodney Dangerfield
My marriage is on the rocks again, yeah, my wife just broke up with her boyfriend.::Rodney Dangerfield
I haven't spoken to my wife in years. I didn't want to interrupt her.::Rodney Dangerfield
I worked in a pet store and people would ask how big I would get.::Rodney Dangerfield
I have good looking kids. Thank goodness my wife cheats on me.::Rodney Dangerfield
My mother had morning sickness after I was born.::Rodney Dangerfield
I went to a fight the other night, and a hockey game broke out.::Rodney Dangerfield
I found there was only one way to look thin: hang out with fat people.::Rodney Dangerfield
I get no respect. The way my luck is running, if I was a politician I would be honest.::Rodney Dangerfield
We sleep in separate rooms, we have dinner apart, we take separate vacations - we're doing everything we can to keep our marriage together.::Rodney Dangerfield
At twenty a man is full of fight and hope. He wants to reform the world. When he is seventy he still wants to reform the world, but he know he can't.::Rodney Dangerfield
Men who do things without being told draw the most wages.::Rodney Dangerfield
With my wife I don't get no respect. I made a toast on her birthday to 'the best woman a man ever had.' The waiter joined me.::Rodney Dangerfield
When I was born I was so ugly the doctor slapped my mother.::Rodney Dangerfield
My wife's jealousy is getting ridiculous. The other day she looked at my calendar and wanted to know who May was.::Rodney Dangerfield
I remember the time I was kidnapped and they sent a piece of my finger to my father. He said he wanted more proof.::Rodney Dangerfield
My wife wants sex in the back of the car and she wants me to drive.::Rodney Dangerfield
Acting deals with very delicate emotions. It is not putting up a mask. Each time an actor acts he does not hide he exposes himself.::Rodney Dangerfield
What a dog I got, his favorite bone is in my arm.::Rodney Dangerfield
There is no such whetstone, to sharpen a good wit and encourage a will to learning, as is praise.::Roger Ascham
It is costly wisdom that is bought by experience.::Roger Ascham
Let the master praise him, and say, 'Here ye do well.' For, I assure you, there is no such whetstone to sharpen a good wit, and encourage a will to learning, as is praise.::Roger Ascham
Young children were sooner allured by love, than driven by beating, to attain good learning.::Roger Ascham
In mine opinion, love is fitter than fear, gentleness better than beating, to bring up a child rightly in learning.::Roger Ascham
By experience we find out a short way by a long wandering.::Roger Ascham
Learning teacheth more in one year than experience in twenty.::Roger Ascham
Let him who would enjoy a good future waste none of his present.::Roger Babson
Keep in mind that neither success nor failure is ever final.::Roger Babson
Property may be destroyed and money may lose its purchasing power but, character, health, knowledge and good judgement will always be in demand under all conditions.::Roger Babson
It is wise to keep in mind that neither success nor failure is ever final.::Roger Babson
Reasoning draws a conclusion, but does not make the conclusion certain, unless the mind discovers it by the path of experience.::Roger Bacon
Argument is conclusive, but it does not remove doubt, so that the mind may rest in the sure knowledge of the truth, unless it finds it by the method of experiment.::Roger Bacon
For the things of this world cannot be made known without a knowledge of mathematics.::Roger Bacon
All science requires mathematics. The knowledge of mathematical things is almost innate in us. This is the easiest of sciences, a fact which is obvious in that no one's brain rejects it for laymen and people who are utterly illiterate know how to count and reckon.::Roger Bacon
I lived on the top of one hill and the school was at the top of another hill. Nobody ever went to school by car - we didn't have any cars during the war. So that to and from school was itself a training.::Roger Bannister
Mothers, unless they were very poor, didn't work. Both of my parents had to leave education. My mother had to work in a cotton mill until 18 or 19, when she took some training in domestic science.::Roger Bannister
I was showing early symptoms of becoming a professional baseball man. I was lying to the press.::Roger Kahn
Football is violence and cold weather and sex and college rye.::Roger Kahn
Tennis and golf are best played, not watched.::Roger Kahn
A lot of victims, for example, have become addicted to alcohol and drugs. It seems to me that the church's healing ministry is going to be enhanced through this in much broader strokes. That's good, it's all positive.::Roger Mahony
The war on terrorism has made national security a legitimate concern, and a rising deficit, changes brought on by globalization and even the price of oil have thrown the nation's economic health into question.::Roger Mahony
With respect to Holy Communion, it is up to the communicant to decide whether they are in a state of grace and worthy to receive the Eucharist. Each one of us makes that decision.::Roger Mahony
Whereas with poetry no one has to show anybody really, and you don't have to tell anyone you're doing it.::Roger McGough
If I do a poetry reading I want people to walk out and say they feel better for having been there - not because you've done a comedy performance but because you're talking about your father dying or having young children, things that touch your soul.::Roger McGough
Some people walk in the rain, others just get wet.::Roger Miller
Tony and I had a good on and off screen relationship, we are two very different people, but we did share a sense of humor, we now live in different parts of the world but when we find ourselves in the same place it is more or less as if there had been no years in between.::Roger Moore
Teach love, generosity, good manners and some of that will drift from the classroom to the home and who knows, the children will be educating the parents.::Roger Moore
Sometimes I've had to put myself on a diet.::Roger Moore
It's wonderful to travel with somebody that you love and we never travel anywhere without one another.::Roger Moore
To be associated with success is absolutely wonderful.::Roger Moore
The wonderful thing about age is that your knees don't work as well, you can't run down steps quite as easily and obviously you can't lift heavy weights. But your mind doesn't feel any different.::Roger Moore
I nearly died of double bronchial pneumonia at the age of five.::Roger Moore
There is nothing glamorous about death.::Roger Moore
I've learnt that through life you just get on with it. You're going to meet a lot of dishonest people along the line and you say good luck to them. I hope they live in comfort. Then I start sticking more pins in their effigies.::Roger Moore
I speak relatively little, except when I'm at home and I'm asking for things.::Roger Moore
It's easy to sit in relative luxury and peace and pontificate on the subject of the Third World debts.::Roger Moore
The relationship between press and politician - protected by the Constitution and designed to be happily adversarial - becomes sour, raw and confrontational.::Roger Mudd
So long as we have enough people in this country willing to fight for their rights, we'll be called a democracy.::Roger Nash Baldwin
I cannot consistently, with self respect, do other than I have, namely, to deliberately violate an act which seems to me to be a denial of everything which ideally and in practice I hold sacred.::Roger Nash Baldwin
But I think it is a serious issue to wonder about the other platonic absolutes of say beauty and morality.::Roger Penrose
This book is about physics and its about physics and its relationship with mathematics and how they seem to be intimately related and to what extent can you explore this relationship and trust it.::Roger Penrose
But communication is two-sided - vital and profound communication makes demands also on those who are to receive it... demands in the sense of concentration, of genuine effort to receive what is being communicated.::Roger Sessions
Not all is doom and gloom. We are beginning to understand the natural world and are gaining a reverence for life - all life.::Roger Tory Peterson
Birds are indicators of the environment. If they are in trouble, we know we'll soon be in trouble.::Roger Tory Peterson
Birds have wings they're free they can fly where they want when they want. They have the kind of mobility many people envy.::Roger Tory Peterson
While I had often said that I wanted to die in bed, what I really meant was that in my old age I wanted to be stepped on by an elephant while making love.::Roger Zelazny
People ask me what I do in winter when there's no baseball. I'll tell you what I do. I stare out the window and wait for spring.::Rogers Hornsby
I don't want to play golf. When I hit a ball, I want someone else to go chase it.::Rogers Hornsby
Through the mythology of Einstein, the world blissfully regained the image of knowledge reduced to a formula.::Roland Barthes
Language is legislation, speech is its code. We do not see the power which is in speech because we forget that all speech is a classification, and that all classifications are oppressive.::Roland Barthes
There is only one way left to escape the alienation of present day society: to retreat ahead of it.::Roland Barthes
Communication leads to community, that is, to understanding, intimacy and mutual valuing.::Rollo May
Courage is not the absence of despair it is, rather, the capacity to move ahead in spite of despair.::Rollo May
Depression is the inability to construct a future.::Rollo May
The relationship between commitment and doubt is by no means an antagonistic one. Commitment is healthiest when it's not without doubt but in spite of doubt.::Rollo May
The opposite of courage in our society is not cowardice, it is conformity.::Rollo May
Creativity is not merely the innocent spontaneity of our youth and childhood it must also be married to the passion of the adult human being, which is a passion to live beyond one's death.::Rollo May
Joy, rather than happiness, is the goal of life, for joy is the emotion which accompanies our fulfilling our natures as human beings. It is based on the experience of one's identity as a being of worth and dignity.::Rollo May
Human freedom involves our capacity to pause, to choose the one response toward which we wish to throw our weight.::Rollo May
Freedom is man's capacity to take a hand in his own development. It is our capacity to mold ourselves.::Rollo May
It requires greater courage to preserve inner freedom, to move on in one's inward journey into new realms, than to stand defiantly for outer freedom. It is often easier to play the martyr, as it is to be rash in battle.::Rollo May
Humor is an affirmation of dignity, a declaration of man's superiority to all that befalls him.::Romain Gary
It is the artist's business to create sunshine when the sun fails.::Romain Rolland
Skepticism, riddling the faith of yesterday, prepared the way for the faith of tomorrow.::Romain Rolland
One makes mistakes that is life. But it is never a mistake to have loved.::Romain Rolland
If there is one place on the face of earth where all the dreams of living men have found a home from the very earliest days when man began the dream of existence, it is India.::Romain Rolland
In Paris, one is always reminded of being a foreigner. If you park your car wrong, it is not the fact that it's on the sidewalk that matters, but the fact that you speak with an accent.::Roman Polanski
I think that was a moment of cool panic there.::Ron Atkinson
Failure is not a crime. The crime is not trying.::Ron Dellums
What is not conservative about saying, 'Don't go to war unless we go to war properly with a full declaration of war and no other way?'::Ron Paul
There is only one kind of freedom and that's individual liberty. Our lives come from our creator and our liberty comes from our creator. It has nothing to do with government granting it.::Ron Paul
As recent as the year 2000 we won elections by saying we shouldn't be the policemen of the world, and that we should not be nation building. And its time we got those values back into this country.::Ron Paul
War is never economically beneficial except for those in position to profit from war expenditures.::Ron Paul
Deficits mean future tax increases, pure and simple. Deficit spending should be viewed as a tax on future generations, and politicians who create deficits should be exposed as tax hikers.::Ron Paul
In time it will become clear to everyone that support for the policies of pre-emptive war and interventionist nation-building will have much greater significance than the removal of Saddam Hussein itself.::Ron Paul
Having federal officials, whether judges, bureaucrats, or congressmen, impose a new definition of marriage on the people is an act of social engineering profoundly hostile to liberty.::Ron Paul
1913 wasn't a very good year. 1913 gave us the income tax, the 16th amendment and the IRS.::Ron Paul
The most important element of a free society, where individual rights are held in the highest esteem, is the rejection of the initiation of violence.::Ron Paul
There's nothing wrong with being a Conservative and coming up with a Conservative believe in foreign policy where we have a strong national defense and we don't go to war so carelessly.::Ron Paul
Another term for preventive war is aggressive war - starting wars because someday somebody might do something to us. That is not part of the American tradition.::Ron Paul
I had the privilege of practicing medicine in the early '60s, before we had any government. It worked rather well, and there was nobody on the street suffering with no medical care.::Ron Paul
Just think of what Woodrow Wilson stood for: he stood for world government. He wanted an early United Nations, League of Nations. But it was the conservatives, Republicans, that stood up against him.::Ron Paul
I have never met anyone who did not support our troops. Sometimes, however, we hear accusations that someone or some group does not support the men and women serving in our Armed Forces. But this is pure demagoguery, and it is intellectually dishonest.::Ron Paul
I am just absolutely convinced that the best formula for giving us peace and preserving the American way of life is freedom, limited government, and minding our own business overseas.::Ron Paul
If you like small government you need to work hard at having a strong national defense that is not so militant. Personal liberty is the purpose of government, to protect liberty - not to run your personal life, not to run the economy, and not to pretend that we can tell the world how they ought to live.::Ron Paul
When one gets in bed with government, one must expect the diseases it spreads.::Ron Paul
Throughout the 20th century, the Republican Party benefited from a non-interventionist foreign policy. Think of how Eisenhower came in to stop the Korean War. Think of how Nixon was elected to stop the mess in Vietnam.::Ron Paul
Justifying conscription to promote the cause of liberty is one of the most bizarre notions ever conceived by man! Forced servitude, with the risk of death and serious injury as a price to live free, makes no sense.::Ron Paul
I like Mitt Romney as a person. I think he's a dignified person. But I have no common ground on economics. He doesn't worry about the Federal Reserve. He doesn't worry about foreign policy. He doesn't talk about civil liberties, so I would have a hard time to expect him to ever invite me to campaign with him.::Ron Paul
To me, to be a conservative means to conserve the good parts of America and to conserve our Constitution.::Ron Paul
Setting a good example is a far better way to spread ideals than through force of arms.::Ron Paul
I am absolutely opposed to a national ID card. This is a total contradiction of what a free society is all about. The purpose of government is to protect the secrecy and the privacy of all individuals, not the secrecy of government. We don't need a national ID card.::Ron Paul
Back a hundred years ago, especially around Woodrow Wilson, what happened in this country is we took freedom and we chopped it into pieces.::Ron Paul
Think of what happened after 9\/11, the minute before there was any assessment, there was glee in the administration because now we can invade Iraq, and so the war drums beat.::Ron Paul
Cliches about supporting the troops are designed to distract from failed policies, policies promoted by powerful special interests that benefit from war, anything to steer the discussion away from the real reasons the war in Iraq will not end anytime soon.::Ron Paul
When the federal government spends more each year than it collects in tax revenues, it has three choices: It can raise taxes, print money, or borrow money. While these actions may benefit politicians, all three options are bad for average Americans.::Ron Paul
There is nothing wrong with describing Conservatism as protecting the Constitution, protecting all things that limit government. Government is the enemy of liberty. Government should be very restrained.::Ron Paul
A system of capitalism presumes sound money, not fiat money manipulated by a central bank. Capitalism cherishes voluntary contracts and interest rates that are determined by savings, not credit creation by a central bank.::Ron Paul
You don't have freedom because you are a hyphenated American you have freedom because you are an individual, and that should be protected.::Ron Paul
I think a submarine is a very worthwhile weapon. I believe we can defend ourselves with submarines and all our troops back at home. This whole idea that we have to be in 130 countries and 900 bases... is an old-fashioned idea.::Ron Paul
Death used to announce itself in the thick of life but now people drag on so long it sometimes seems that we are reaching the stage when we may have to announce ourselves to death. It is as though one needs a special strength to die, and not a final weakness.::Ronald Blythe
Math is sometimes called the science of patterns.::Ronald Graham
A lot of the high-level sports are really in your mind.::Ronald Graham
I mean he's a very famous director... they're not going to put their... and he's very tough, he doesn't like interference at all, so he kept them at bay.::Ronald Harwood
No matter what time it is, wake me, even if it's in the middle of a Cabinet meeting.::Ronald Reagan
Democracy is worth dying for, because it's the most deeply honorable form of government ever devised by man.::Ronald Reagan
Politics I supposed to be the second-oldest profession. I have come to realize that it bears a very close resemblance to the first.::Ronald Reagan
The taxpayer - that's someone who works for the federal government but doesn't have to take the civil service examination.::Ronald Reagan
History teaches that war begins when governments believe the price of aggression is cheap.::Ronald Reagan
I've never been able to understand why a Republican contributor is a 'fat cat' and a Democratic contributor of the same amount of money is a 'public-spirited philanthropist'.::Ronald Reagan
Without God, democracy will not and cannot long endure.::Ronald Reagan
Concentrated power has always been the enemy of liberty.::Ronald Reagan
We should declare war on North Vietnam. We could pave the whole country and put parking strips on it, and still be home by Christmas.::Ronald Reagan
Today, if you invent a better mousetrap, the government comes along with a better mouse.::Ronald Reagan
Politics is just like show business. You have a hell of an opening, coast for a while, and then have a hell of a close.::Ronald Reagan
Trust, but verify.::Ronald Reagan
What we have found in this country, and maybe we're more aware of it now, is one problem that we've had, even in the best of times, and that is the people who are sleeping on the grates, the homeless, you might say, by choice.::Ronald Reagan
Before I refuse to take your questions, I have an opening statement.::Ronald Reagan
Within the covers of the Bible are the answers for all the problems men face.::Ronald Reagan
Let us be sure that those who come after will say of us in our time, that in our time we did everything that could be done. We finished the race we kept them free we kept the faith.::Ronald Reagan
All great change in America begins at the dinner table.::Ronald Reagan
All the waste in a year from a nuclear power plant can be stored under a desk.::Ronald Reagan
Government's view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases: If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it.::Ronald Reagan
Government's first duty is to protect the people, not run their lives.::Ronald Reagan
There are no easy answers' but there are simple answers. We must have the courage to do what we know is morally right.::Ronald Reagan
There are no great limits to growth because there are no limits of human intelligence, imagination, and wonder.::Ronald Reagan
Government is like a baby. An alimentary canal with a big appetite at one end and no sense of responsibility at the other.::Ronald Reagan
Government exists to protect us from each other. Where government has gone beyond its limits is in deciding to protect us from ourselves.::Ronald Reagan
The most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the government and I'm here to help.::Ronald Reagan

It's difficult to believe that people are still starving in this country because food isn't available.::Ronald Reagan
It doesn't do good to open doors for someone who doesn't have the price to get in. If he has the price, he may not need the laws. There is no law saying the Negro has to live in Harlem or Watts.::Ronald Reagan

Discount air fares, a car in every parking space and the interstate highway system have made every place accessible - and every place alike.::Ronald Steel

The current wisdom now is that if the three networks are covering the news the same way the difference is the anchor people. I think that won't be true in the future.::Roone Arledge

If you don't accept failure as a possibility, you don't set high goals, you don't branch out, you don't try - you don't take the risk.::Rosalynn Carter
You must accept that you might fail then, if you do your best and still don't win, at least you can be satisfied that you've tried. If you don't accept failure as a possibility, you don't set high goals, you don't branch out, you don't try - you don't take the risk.::Rosalynn Carter
There is nothing more important than a good, safe, secure home.::Rosalynn Carter
I looked on child rearing not only as a work of love and duty but as a profession that was fully as interesting and challenging as any honorable profession in the world and one that demanded the best that I could bring to it.::Rose Kennedy
What greater aspiration and challenge are there for a mother than the hope of raising a great son or daughter?::Rose Kennedy
I've had an exciting time I married for love and got a little money along with it.::Rose Kennedy

It's our money, and we're free to spend it any way we please.::Rose Kennedy

Neither comprehension nor learning can take place in an atmosphere of anxiety.::Rose Kennedy
I came out of the Soviet Union no longer a communist, because I believed in personal freedom.::Rose Wilder Lane
Most people give up just when they're about to achieve success. They quit on the one yard line. They give up at the last minute of the game one foot from a winning touchdown.::Ross Perot
Spend a lot of time talking to customers face to face. You'd be amazed how many companies don't listen to their customers.::Ross Perot
Business is not just doing deals business is having great products, doing great engineering, and providing tremendous service to customers. Finally, business is a cobweb of human relationships.::Ross Perot

We can do better in higher education. And it is more than just technology. It's also an attitude on the part of faculty. We need to think through how we can produce a better quality product at less cost.::Roy Romer
Freedom is a muscle... you have to exercise it.::Roy Scheider

It may be that the satisfaction I need depends on my going away, so that when I've gone and come back, I'll find it at home.::Rumi
This is love: to fly toward a secret sky, to cause a hundred veils to fall each moment. First to let go of life. Finally, to take a step without feet.::Rumi
Let the beauty of what you love be what you do.::Rumi
Breathless, we flung us on a windy hill, Laughed in the sun, and kissed the lovely grass.::Rupert Brooke

I felt that it's best just to be as transparent as possible.::Rupert Murdoch
The UK desperately needs less government and freer markets.::Rupert Murdoch
I'm not a knee-jerk conservative. I passionately believe in free markets and less government, but not to the point of being a libertarian.::Rupert Murdoch
So long as I can stay mentally alert - inquiring, curious - I want to keep going. I love my wife and my children, but I don't want to sit around at home with them. We go on safaris and things like that. I can do that for a couple of weeks a year. I'm just not ready to stop, to die.::Rupert Murdoch
We've got to lift our game tremendously. We'll sell our business news and information in print, we'll sell it to anyone who's got a cable system, and we'll sell it on the Web.::Rupert Murdoch
The buck stops with the guy who signs the checks.::Rupert Murdoch
I'm considered homophobic and crazy about these things and old fashioned. But I think that the family - father, mother, children - is fundamental to our civilisation.::Rupert Murdoch
In motivating people, you've got to engage their minds and their hearts. I motivate people, I hope, by example - and perhaps by excitement, by having productive ideas to make others feel involved.::Rupert Murdoch
It's a libel to say that I use my newspapers to support my other business interests. The fact is, I haven't got any other business interests.::Rupert Murdoch
One thing I resent is the slur that I just support political candidates because of the business.::Rupert Murdoch
When you're a catalyst for change, you make enemies - and I'm proud of the ones I've got.::Rupert Murdoch
The world is changing very fast. Big will not beat small anymore. It will be the fast beating the slow.::Rupert Murdoch
Money is not the motivating force. It's nice to have money, but I don't live high. What I enjoy is running the business.::Rupert Murdoch
Everybody at home speaks mandarin except me.::Rupert Murdoch
Advances in the technology of telecommunications have proved an unambiguous threat to totalitarian regimes everywhere.::Rupert Murdoch
I'm a strange mixture of my mother's curiosity my father, who grew up the son of the manse in a Presbyterian family, who had a tremendous sense of duty and responsibility and my mother's father, who was always in trouble with gambling debts.::Rupert Murdoch
No one's going to be able to operate without a grounding in the basic sciences. Language would be helpful, although English is becoming increasingly international. And travel. You have to have a global attitude.::Rupert Murdoch
Those who remember Washington's cold war culture in the 1980s will recall the shocked reactions to Reagan's intervention. People interested in foreign policy were astonished when in 1985 he met alone at Geneva - alone, not a single strategic thinker at his elbow! - with the Soviet Communist master Gorbachev.::Russell Baker
In an age when the fashion is to be in love with yourself, confessing to be in love with somebody else is an admission of unfaithfulness to one's beloved.::Russell Baker
When it comes to cars, only two varieties of people are possible - cowards and fools.::Russell Baker
Rereading A.J. Liebling carries me happily back to an age when all good journalists knew they had plenty to be modest about, and were.::Russell Baker
There is a growing literature about the multitude of journalism's problems, but most of it is concerned with the editorial side of the business, possibly because most people competent to write about journalism are not comfortable writing about finance.::Russell Baker
A day spent praising the earth and lamenting man's pollutionist history makes you feel like a superior, sensitive soul.::Russell Baker
Except for politics, no business is scrutinized more exhaustively than journalism.::Russell Baker
I gave up on new poetry myself 30 years ago when most of it began to read like coded messages passing between lonely aliens in a hostile world.::Russell Baker
Like all young reporters - brilliant or hopelessly incompetent - I dreamed of the glamorous life of the foreign correspondent: prowling Vienna in a Burberry trench coat, speaking a dozen languages to dangerous women, narrowly escaping Sardinian bandits - the usual stuff that newspaper dreams are made of.::Russell Baker
Strategic thinkers were naturally rattled to find this outsider fooling around with their work. They had been thinking strategically when Reagan was just another movie actor playing opposite a chimpanzee, for heaven's sake. They think Reagan is too naive, too innocent, to grasp the intellectual complexities of cold war strategy.::Russell Baker
Anticipating that most poetry will be worse than carrying heavy luggage through O'Hare Airport, the public, to its loss, reads very little of it.::Russell Baker
What the New Yorker calls home would seem like a couple of closets to most Americans, yet he manages not only to live there but also to grow trees and cockroaches right on the premises.::Russell Baker
Poetry is so vital to us until school spoils it.::Russell Baker
Is fuel efficiency really what we need most desperately? I say that what we really need is a car that can be shot when it breaks down.::Russell Baker
Inanimate objects can be classified scientifically into three major categories those that don't work, those that break down and those that get lost.::Russell Baker
Usually, terrible things that are done with the excuse that progress requires them are not really progress at all, but just terrible things.::Russell Baker
Don't try to make children grow up to be like you, or they may do it.::Russell Baker
Anything that isn't opposed by about 40 percent of humanity is either an evil business or so unimportant that it simply doesn't matter.::Russell Baker
Children rarely want to know who their parents were before they were parents, and when age finally stirs their curiosity, there is no parent left to tell them.::Russell Baker
Few expected very much of Franklin Roosevelt on Inauguration Day in 1933. Like Barack Obama seventy-six years later, he was succeeding a failed Republican president, and Americans had voted for change. What that change might be Roosevelt never clearly said, probably because he himself didn't know.::Russell Baker
Reporters thrive on the world's misfortune. For this reason they often take an indecent pleasure in events that dismay the rest of humanity.::Russell Baker
Newspaper people, once celebrated as founts of ribald humor and uncouth fun, have of late lost all their gaiety, and small wonder.::Russell Baker
An educated person is one who has learned that information almost always turns out to be at best incomplete and very often false, misleading, fictitious, mendacious - just dead wrong.::Russell Baker
When sudden death takes a president, opportunities for new beginnings flourish among the ambitious and the tensions among such people can be dramatic, as they were when President Kennedy was killed.::Russell Baker
Ah, summer, what power you have to make us suffer and like it.::Russell Baker
The best discussion of trouble in boardroom and business office is found in newspapers' own financial pages and speeches by journalists in management jobs.::Russell Baker
Americans like fat books and thin women.::Russell Baker
You can always tell folks from nonfolks. Folks like to feel good, like to smile for the camera when there's a big photo opportunity for a really good cause.::Russell Baker
Listen once in a while. It's amazing what you can hear.::Russell Baker
Roosevelt's declaration that Americans had 'nothing to fear but fear itself' was a glorious piece of inspirational rhetoric and just as gloriously wrong.::Russell Baker
Cynicism is the intellectual cripple's substitute for intelligence.::Russell Lynes
The bungalow had more to do with how Americans live today than any other building that has gone remotely by the name of architecture in our history.::Russell Lynes
We were born to die and we die to live. As seedlings of God, we barely blossom on earth we fully flower in heaven.::Russell M. Nelson
Eternal principles that govern happiness apply equally to all.::Russell M. Nelson
I'd like to talk about free markets. Information in the computer age is the last genuine free market left on earth except those free markets where indigenous people are still surviving. And that's basically becoming limited.::Russell Means
So Indian policy has become institutionalized and the result has been that American people have become more dependent on government and that the American people have become more dependent on corporations.::Russell Means
In the government schools, which are referred to as public schools, Indian policy has been instituted there, and its a policy where they do not encourage, in fact, discourage, critical thinking and the creation of ideas and public education.::Russell Means
Our promise to our children should be this: if you do well in school, we will pay for you to obtain a college degree.::Ruth Ann Minner
Benjamin Franklin said there were only two things certain in life: death and taxes. But I'd like to add a third certainty: trash. And while some in this room might want to discuss reducing taxes, I want to talk about reducing trash.::Ruth Ann Minner
Women will only have true equality when men share with them the responsibility of bringing up the next generation.::Ruth Bader Ginsburg
I said on the equality side of it, that it is essential to a woman's equality with man that she be the decision-maker, that her choice be controlling.::Ruth Bader Ginsburg
The state controlling a woman would mean denying her full autonomy and full equality.::Ruth Bader Ginsburg
She never envisioned a legal career for me, but she did think it was very important that I be able to support myself, and I think she would be pleased to see what has become of me.::Ruth Bader Ginsburg
All respect for the office of the presidency aside, I assumed that the obvious and unadulterated decline of freedom and constitutional sovereignty, not to mention the efforts to curb the power of judicial review, spoke for itself.::Ruth Bader Ginsburg
We grow in time to trust the future for our answers.::Ruth Benedict
I haven't strength of mind not to need a career.::Ruth Benedict
I gambled on having the strength to live two lives, one for myself and one for the world.::Ruth Benedict
The ground we walk on, the plants and creatures, the clouds above constantly dissolving into new formations - each gift of nature possessing its own radiant energy, bound together by cosmic harmony.::Ruth Bernhard
Courage is very important. Like a muscle, it is strengthened by use.::Ruth Gordon

They were using the dolls to project their dreams of their own futures as adult women.::Ruth Handler
In a still hot morning, the tide went out and didn't come back in. This was not a spectacular event. The sea did not roll up like a scroll, like the sky in Revelations. It quietly withdrew.::Ruth Park
The knives of jealousy are honed on details.::Ruth Rendell
I've had two proposals since I've been a widow. I am a wonderful catch, you know. I have a lot of money.::Ruth Rendell
The real message of the Dance opens up the vistas of life to all who have the urge to express beauty with no other instrument than their own bodies, with no apparatus and no dependence on anything other than space.::Ruth St. Denis
Our bodies are at once the receiving and transmitting stations for life itself. It is the highest wisdom to recognize this fact and train our bodies to render them sensitive and responsive to nature. art and religion.::Ruth St. Denis
I see dance being used as communication between body and soul, to express what it too deep to find for words.::Ruth St. Denis
I do like to shock and surprise people. When it's all in good fun, of course.::Ruth Warrick
Talking from morning to night about sex has helped my skiing, because I talk about movement, about looking good, about taking risks.::Ruth Westheimer
Universal suffrage should rest upon universal education. To this end, liberal and permanent provision should be made for the support of free schools by the State governments, and, if need be, supplemented by legitimate aid from national authority.::Rutherford B. Hayes
The independence of all political and other bother is a happiness.::Rutherford B. Hayes
The filth and noise of the crowded streets soon destroy the elasticity of health which belongs to the country boy.::Rutherford B. Hayes
Law without education is a dead letter. With education the needed law follows without effort and, of course, with power to execute itself indeed, it seems to execute itself.::Rutherford B. Hayes
I am less disposed to think of a West Point education as requisite for this business than I was at first. Good sense and energy are the qualities required.::Rutherford B. Hayes
Wars will remain while human nature remains. I believe in my soul in cooperation, in arbitration but the soldier's occupation we cannot say is gone until human nature is gone.::Rutherford B. Hayes
Do not let your bachelor ways crystallize so that you can't soften them when you come to have a wife and a family of your own.::Rutherford B. Hayes
No person connected with me by blood or marriage will be appointed to office.::Rutherford B. Hayes
The progress of society is mainly the improvement in the condition of the workingmen of the world.::Rutherford B. Hayes

An ideal wife is one who remains faithful to you but tries to be just as charming as if she weren't.::Sacha Guitry
The best way to turn a woman's head is to tell her she has a beautiful profile.::Sacha Guitry
When a man steals your wife, there is no better revenge than to let him keep her.::Sacha Guitry
Our wisdom comes from our experience, and our experience comes from our foolishness.::Sacha Guitry
The secret of a good marriage is forgiving your partner for marrying you in the first place.::Sacha Guitry
Ascetics and fakirs come to mitigate human suffering to heal us and lead us on the path. They put up with criticism they go through many worldly trials. Some of them have even become martyrs for our sake. But they have done all this with a smile and with gratitude to God. Hence sacrifice is a great virtue.::Sadhu Vaswani
If I be worthy, I live for my God to teach the heathen, even though they may despise me.::Saint Patrick
If I have any worth, it is to live my life for God so as to teach these peoples even though some of them still look down on me.::Saint Patrick
No one should ever say that it was my ignorance if I did or showed forth anything however small according to God's good pleasure but let this be your conclusion and let it so be thought, that - as is the perfect truth - it was the gift of God.::Saint Patrick
We cannot both preach and administer financial matters.::Saint Stephen
You desire that which exceeds my humble powers, but I trust in the compassion and mercy of the All-powerful God.::Saint Stephen

All who consult on doubtful matters, should be void of hatred, friendship, anger, and pity.::Sallust
All those who offer an opinion on any doubtful point should first clear their minds of every sentiment of dislike, friendship, anger or pity.::Sallust
As the blessings of health and fortune have a beginning, so they must also find an end. Everything rises but to fall, and increases but to decay.::Sallust
It is a law of human nature that in victory even the coward may boast of his prowess, while defeat injures the reputation even of the brave.::Sallust
The fame that goes with wealth and beauty is fleeting and fragile intellectual superiority is a possession glorious and eternal.::Sallust
A good man would prefer to be defeated than to defeat injustice by evil means.::Sallust
Neither soldiers nor money can defend a king but only friends won by good deeds, merit, and honesty.::Sallust
Well, it was the beginning of my film career. It was amazing to me that I got nominated for an Academy Award.::Sally Kellerman
I was also the romantic lead in The Boston Strangler - I was the only one that lived to tell the story - so I called myself the romantic lead.::Sally Kellerman
All men are born equally free.::Salmon P. Chase
Poetry is the revelation of a feeling that the poet believes to be interior and personal which the reader recognizes as his own.::Salvatore Quasimodo
Poetry is also the physical self of the poet, and it is impossible to separate the poet from his poetry.::Salvatore Quasimodo
He passes from lyric to epic poetry in order to speak about the world and the torment in the world through man, rationally and emotionally. The poet then becomes a danger.::Salvatore Quasimodo
In opposition to this detachment, he finds an image of man which contains within itself man's dreams, man's illness, man's redemption from the misery of poverty - poverty which can no longer be for him a sign of the acceptance of life.::Salvatore Quasimodo

Life is but thought.::Sara Teasdale
Beauty, more than bitterness, makes the heart break.::Sara Teasdale
Life has loveliness to sell, all beautiful and splendid things, blue waves whitened on a cliff, soaring fire that sways and sings, and children's faces looking up, holding wonder like a cup.::Sara Teasdale
The truth, the absolute truth, is that the chief beauty for the theatre consists in fine bodily proportions.::Sarah Bernhardt
What matters poverty? What matters anything to him who is enamoured of our art? Does he not carry in himself every joy and every beauty?::Sarah Bernhardt
Legend remains victorious in spite of history.::Sarah Bernhardt
He who is incapable of feeling strong passions, of being shaken by anger, of living in every sense of the word, will never be a good actor.::Sarah Bernhardt
Your words are my food, your breath my wine. You are everything to me.::Sarah Bernhardt
Permanent success cannot be achieved except by incessant intellectual labour, always inspired by the ideal.::Sarah Bernhardt
The loss of liberty which must attend being a wife was of all things the most horrible to my imagination.::Sarah Fielding
The words of kindness are more healing to a drooping heart than balm or honey.::Sarah Fielding
It is the people who can do nothing who find nothing to do, and the secret to happiness in this world is not only to be useful, but to be forever elevating one's uses.::Sarah Orne Jewett
Yes'm, old friends is always best, 'less you can catch a new one that's fit to make an old one out of.::Sarah Orne Jewett
The Peace Corps would give thousands of young Americans a chance to see at first hand the conditions in remote areas of the world.::Sargent Shriver
It is precisely our job as Catholics to speak the truth as plainly and precisely as we can.::Sargent Shriver
I don't have to run the Peace Corps. I could live without seeing my picture in the newspapers and without being interviewed.::Sargent Shriver
Does politics have to be injected into everything?::Sargent Shriver
Respect for another man's opinion is worthy. It is the realization that any opinion is valuable, for it is the sign of a rational being.::Sargent Shriver
I want to warn anyone who sees the Peace Corps as an alternative to the draft that life may well be easier at Fort Dix or at apost in Germany than it will be with us.::Sargent Shriver
Racism cannot be cured solely by attacking some of the results it produces, like discrimination in housing or in education.::Sargent Shriver
The only genuine elite is the elite of those men and women who gave their lives to justice and charity.::Sargent Shriver
Do we talk about the dignity of work? Do we give our students any reason for believing it is worthwhile to sacrifice for their work because such sacrifices improve the psychological and mental health of the person who makes them?::Sargent Shriver
As far as I was concerned, the Depression was an ill wind that blew some good. If it hadn't occurred, my parents would have given me my college education. As it was, I had to scrabble for it.::Sargent Shriver
The Peace Corps is guilty of enthusiasm and a crusading spirit. But we're not apologetic about it.::Sargent Shriver
If education does not create a need for the best in life, then we are stuck in an undemocratic, rigid caste society.::Sargent Shriver
In the Peace Corps, the volunteer must be a fully developed, mature person. He must not join to run abroad or escape problems.::Sargent Shriver
Any idealist who tries to join the Peace Corps must realize he is not going to change the world overnight.::Sargent Shriver
Just to travel is rather boring, but to travel with a purpose is educational and exciting.::Sargent Shriver
We want deeper sincerity of motive, a greater courage in speech and earnestness in action.::Sarojini Naidu
Just take the ball and throw it where you want to. Throw strikes. Home plate don't move.::Satchel Paige
It's funny what a few no-hitters do for a body.::Satchel Paige
Don't pray when it rains if you don't pray when the sun shines.::Satchel Paige
Money and women. They're two of the strongest things in the world. The things you do for a woman you wouldn't do for anything else. Same with money.::Satchel Paige
Don't look back. Something might be gaining on you.::Satchel Paige
Work like you don't need the money. Love like you've never been hurt. Dance like nobody's watching.::Satchel Paige
If your stomach disputes you, lie down and pacify it with cool thoughts.::Satchel Paige
Age is a case of mind over matter. If you don't mind, it don't matter.::Satchel Paige
The only change is that baseball has turned Paige from a second class citizen to a second class immortal.::Satchel Paige
How old would you be if you didn't know how old you are?::Satchel Paige
That was my childhood. I grew up with the monks, studying Sanskrit and meditating for hours in the morning and hours in the evening, and going once a day to beg for food.::Satish Kumar
If you can kill animals, the same attitude can kill human beings. The mentality is the same which exploits nature and which creates wars.::Satish Kumar
At the age when Bengali youth almost inevitably writes poetry, I was listening to European classical music.::Satyajit Ray
Most of the top actors and actresses may be working in ten or twelve films at the same time, so they will give one director two hours and maybe shoot in Bombay in the morning and Madras in the evening. It happens.::Satyajit Ray
I think they quite like me when I work because I'm one of the safer directors to back, because even if my films don't bring their costs in back home, once they're shown outside of India they manage to cover the costs.::Satyajit Ray
Life is a corrupting process from the time a child learns to play his mother off against his father in the politics of when to go to bed he who fears corruption fears life.::Saul Alinsky
The greatest enemy of individual freedom is the individual himself.::Saul Alinsky
Change means movement. Movement means friction. Only in the frictionless vacuum of a nonexistent abstract world can movement or change occur without that abrasive friction of conflict.::Saul Alinsky
Once you accept your own death, all of a sudden you're free to live. You no longer care about your reputation. You no longer care except so far as your life can be used tactically to promote a cause you believe in.::Saul Alinsky
A racially integrated community is a chronological term timed from the entrance of the first black family to the exit of the last white family.::Saul Alinsky
I think that New York is not the cultural centre of America, but the business and administrative centre of American culture.::Saul Bellow
A man is only as good as what he loves.::Saul Bellow
A great deal of intelligence can be invested in ignorance when the need for illusion is deep.::Saul Bellow
There are evils that have the ability to survive identification and go on for ever... money, for instance, or war.::Saul Bellow
What is art but a way of seeing?::Saul Bellow
If women are expected to do the same work as men, we must teach them the same things.::Saul Bellow
The frightening thought that what you draw may become a building makes for reasoned lines.::Saul Steinberg
These martyrs of patriotism gave their lives for an idea.::Schuyler Colfax
I'm never less at leisure than when at leisure, or less alone than when alone.::Scipio Africanus
Do the best that you can in the place where you are, and be kind.::Scott Nearing
The fact of the matter is that the most unexpected and miraculous thing in my life was the arrival in it of poetry itself - as a vocation and an elevation almost.::Seamus Heaney
Whether it be a matter of personal relations within a marriage or political initiatives within a peace process, there is no sure-fire do-it-yourself kit.::Seamus Heaney
In fact, in lyric poetry, truthfulness becomes recognizable as a ring of truth within the medium itself.::Seamus Heaney
As writers and readers, as sinners and citizens, our realism and our aesthetic sense make us wary of crediting the positive note.::Seamus Heaney
Poetry is always slightly mysterious, and you wonder what is your relationship to it.::Seamus Heaney
A public expectation, it has to be said, not of poetry as such but of political positions variously approvable by mutually disapproving groups.::Seamus Heaney
Manifesting that order of poetry where we can at last grow up to that which we stored up as we grew.::Seamus Heaney
At home in Ireland, there's a habit of avoidance, an ironical attitude towards the authority figure.::Seamus Heaney
But that citizen's perception was also at one with the truth in recognizing that the very brutality of the means by which the IRA were pursuing change was destructive of the trust upon which new possibilities would have to be based.::Seamus Heaney
Even if the hopes you started out with are dashed, hope has to be maintained.::Seamus Heaney
The completely solitary self: that's where poetry comes from, and it gets isolated by crisis, and those crises are often very intimate also.::Seamus Heaney
I credit poetry for making this space-walk possible.::Seamus Heaney
Laughter kills fear, and without fear there can be no faith. For without fear of the devil there is no need for God.::Sean Connery
I've always been hopeful about Scotland's prospects. And I now believe more than ever that Scotland is within touching distance of achieving independence and equality.::Sean Connery
There are women who take it to the wire. That's what they are looking for, the ultimate confrontation. They want a smack.::Sean Connery
There's something fundamentally wrong with a system where there's been 17 years of a Tory Government and the people of Scotland have voted Socialist for 17 years. That hardly seems democratic.::Sean Connery
I like women. I don't understand them, but I like them.::Sean Connery
I'm fed up with the idiots... the ever-widening gap between people who know how to make movies and the people who green-light the movies.::Sean Connery
Ugliness is in a way superior to beauty because it lasts.::Serge Gainsbourg
Questions have arisen about the policing of science. Who is responsible for the policing? My answer is: all of us.::Serge Lang
I object to a legal approach when settling questions of science or scientific behavior.::Serge Lang
In my childhood, America was like a religion. Then, real-life Americans abruptly entered my life - in jeeps - and upset all my dreams.::Sergio Leone
From you we have learned what we, at least, value, to separate Church and State and from you we gather inspiration at all times in our devotion to learning, to religious liberty, and to individual and National freedom.::Seth Low
It doesn't matter that Bush scares the hell out of me. What matters is that he scares the hell out of a lot of very important people in Washington who can't speak out, in the military, in the intelligence community.::Seymour Hersh
The role of the teacher is to create the conditions for invention rather than provide ready-made knowledge.::Seymour Papert
The sad truth is that excellence makes people nervous.::Shana Alexander
Every St. Patrick's Day every Irishman goes out to find another Irishman to make a speech to.::Shane Leslie
We are equally glad and surprised at Winston's return to office. It shows that he was built for success that he should have declined to withdraw and sulk over a superficial failure.::Shane Leslie
He has the obligation to society that any human being has. I don't think a satirist has any greater obligation to society than a bricklayer or anybody else.::Shel Silverstein
Stand-up comics reflect less of a visual humor and more of a commentary.::Shel Silverstein
I will not play tug o' war. I'd rather play hug o' war. Where everyone hugs instead of tugs, Where everyone giggles and rolls on the rug, Where everyone kisses, and everyone grins, and everyone cuddles, and everyone wins.::Shel Silverstein
Tell me I'm clever, Tell me I'm kind, Tell me I'm talented, Tell me I'm cute, Tell me I'm sensitive, Graceful and wise, Tell me I'm perfect - But tell me the truth.::Shel Silverstein
To me, freedom entitles you to do something, not to not do something.::Shel Silverstein
I'm crazy about Grant: his character, his nature, his science in fighting and everything else. But I don't like the idea that he never accepted the blame for anything, always found someone else to blame for any mistake that was ever made, including blaming Prentiss for Shiloh.::Shelby Foote
And I'm a slow writer: five, six hundred words is a good day. That's the reason it took me 20 years to write those million and a half words of the Civil War.::Shelby Foote
I think making mistakes and discovering them for yourself is of great value, but to have someone else to point out your mistakes is a shortcut of the process.::Shelby Foote
I think that everything you do helps you to write if you're a writer. Adversity and success both contribute largely to making you what you are. If you don't experience either one of those, you're being deprived of something.::Shelby Foote
I used to write sonnets and various things, and moved from there into writing prose, which, incidentally, is a lot more interesting than poetry, including the rhythms of prose.::Shelby Foote
I began the way nearly everybody I ever heard of - I began writing poetry. And I find that to be quite usual with writers, their trying their hand at poetry.::Shelby Foote
If I were to retire, I would keep my family's interest in the company the same and say, Don't sell.::Sheldon Adelson
The teacher who would be true to his mission and accomplish the most good, must give prominence to moral as well as intellectual instruction.::Sheldon Jackson
I am in the Master of Professional Writing program teaching Humor Writing, Literary and Dramatic.::Shelley Berman
The old problems - love, money, security, status, health, etc. - are still here to plague us or please us.::Shelley Berman
As a culture I see us as presently deprived of subtleties. The music is loud, the anger is elevated, sex seems lacking in sweetness and privacy.::Shelley Berman
While you're improvising, you may come up with something which will break him up. As soon as that smile comes out, you know that, hey, we're having fun.::Shelley Berman
Teach your children how to behave with animals. Adopt a pet. Don't go buy one. Please. That's a sin. Let's get these puppy mills out of business.::Shelley Morrison
I think on-stage nudity is disgusting, shameful and damaging to all things American. But if I were 22 with a great body, it would be artistic, tasteful, patriotic and a progressive religious experience.::Shelley Winters
I'm just an old hippie. You know, peace and love.::Sherman Hemsley
Having yet another vote on refinery legislation that uses high oil prices as an excuse to weaken environmental protections and to give more legislative gifts to the oil industry is misguided in the extreme.::Sherwood Boehlert
The U.S. uses most of its oil for transportation. We can limit U.S. demand for oil by requiring automakers to use the technology that already exists to improve fuel economy - technology that the automakers refuse to bring into the market despite societal demand.::Sherwood Boehlert
Let me start by emphasizing that I am open to efforts to expedite environmental procedures for true emergencies or in other clear cases where current laws are needlessly burdensome.::Sherwood Boehlert
The problem of the Middle East is poverty more than politics.::Shimon Peres
Israel welcomes the wind of change, and sees a window of opportunity. Democratic and science-based economies by nature desire peace. Israel does not want to be an island of affluence in an ocean of poverty. Improvements in our neighbours' lives mean improvements to the neighbourhood in which we live.::Shimon Peres
Early in the morning, I fell in love with the girl that later on became my wife. At that time, we were so naive. I wanted to charm her, so I read her Capital by Marx. I thought somehow she would be convinced by the strength of his criticism about capital.::Shimon Peres
My heart goes out to the brave citizens of Syria, who each day risk and even sacrifice their lives to achieve freedom from a murderous regime. We in Israel welcome the historic struggle to forge democratic, peace-loving governments in our region.::Shimon Peres
I believe that peace with the Palestinians is most urgent - urgent than ever before. It is necessary. It is crucial. It is possible. A delay may worsen its chances. Israel and the Palestinians are, in my judgment, ripe today to restart the peace process.::Shimon Peres
Look, I worked with American Republican presidents and Democratic presidents, all of them, and each of them has shown a deep and profound friendship to Israel, you know? I can't remember anybody who was in that sense negative as far as Israel is concerned.::Shimon Peres
The Jews' greatest contribution to history is dissatisfaction! We're a nation born to be discontented. Whatever exists we believe can be changed for the better.::Shimon Peres
Now, I learned soon enough, that among the three, two don't trust the third one - the third one is the government. Both industry and unions feel the government is a talking organization and a spending organization.::Shimon Peres
That was my first lesson from Ben-Gurion. Then I saw him making peace, and I saw him making war. He mobilized me before the war. The man was a very rare combination between a real intellectual and a born leader. There is a contradiction between the two.::Shimon Peres
He was the editor of our paper. He created the publishing house in Hebrew. He was - I wouldn't say the 'guru' - but really he was our teacher and a most respected man. I wrote for the paper of the youth movement.::Shimon Peres
I call on the Iranian people: it is not too late to replace the corrupt regime and return to your glorious Persian heritage, a heritage of culture and values and not of bombs and missiles... How can a nation allow a regime to instill fear, take away the people's freedom and shock the young generation that seeks its way out of the dictatorial Iran.::Shimon Peres
The Middle East is ailing. The malady stems from pervasive violence, shortages of food, water and educational opportunities, discrimination against women and - the most virulent cause of all - the absence of freedom.::Shimon Peres
I worked with a group of people who argued day and night - professors, officials, the Minister of Finance - but there were decisions that I had to make.::Shimon Peres
Israel was born under the British mandate. We learned from the British what democracy means, and how it behaves in a time of danger, war and terror. We thank Britain for introducing freedom and respect of human rights both in normal and demanding circumstances.::Shimon Peres
What is wrong with the Iranians in addition to the nuclear bomb? This is the only country on Earth in the 21st century that has renewed imperialistic ambitions. They really want to become the hegemon of the Middle East in an age that gave up imperialism.::Shimon Peres
Bringing an end to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians may help the young Arab generation to realise their aspirations. Israel is more than willing to offer our experience in building a modern economy in spite of limited resources to the whole region.::Shimon Peres
I was learning, as I did in the Ministry of Defense. I never knew, but I always learned.::Shimon Peres
I think peace should be done not only among governments but among people. It was impossible before the Facebook.::Shimon Peres
The Iranian regime suppresses its own people as well as others in the region. It prevents peace by sponsoring terror globally. With the ultimate weapon that it is deceptively developing, the regime aims to gain hegemony over the entire Middle East and hold the world's economy hostage.::Shimon Peres
The United States is the only power in history that became great by giving and not by taking. I think the crisis was when the United States had more money than ideas. Money doesn't produce money. Ideas produce money.::Shimon Peres
When I am speaking about American presidents, I have to speak about my very special relations with President Clinton. He contributed more to peace than anybody else in the American sense.::Shimon Peres
I think I was a good student, because I jumped over a school. My main interest was basically history and literature. Sports were basically basketball and swimming at a pool. I was so happy.::Shimon Peres
The older generation had greater respect for land than science. But we live in an age when science, more than soil, has become the provider of growth and abundance. Living just on the land creates loneliness in an age of globality.::Shimon Peres
What should be the future of Israel? Is the land the most important choice, and for that reason to keep the whole of the land at any cost, or to have a partition and build the Jewish state on part of the land? And the other part?::Shimon Peres
In Israel, a land lacking in natural resources, we learned to appreciate our greatest national advantage: our minds. Through creativity and innovation, we transformed barren deserts into flourishing fields and pioneered new frontiers in science and technology.::Shimon Peres
You know who is against democracy in the Middle East? The husbands. They got used to their way of life. Now, the traditional way of life must change. Everybody must change. If you don't give equal rights to women, you can't progress.::Shimon Peres
Peace with the Palestinians will open ports of peace all around the Mediterranean. The duty of leaders is to pursue freedom ceaselessly, even in the face of hostility, in the face of doubt and disappointment. Just imagine what could be.::Shimon Peres
What is man's ultimate direction in life? It is to look for love, truth, virtue, and beauty.::Shinichi Suzuki
Every child grows everything depends on the teacher.::Shinichi Suzuki
Knowledge is not skill. Knowledge plus ten thousand times is skill.::Shinichi Suzuki
Children learn to smile from their parents.::Shinichi Suzuki
No wedding bells for me anymore. I've been happily married to my profession for years.::Shirley Bassey
I think men are afraid to be with a successful woman, because we are terribly strong, we know what we want and we are not fragile enough.::Shirley Bassey
The emotional, sexual, and psychological stereotyping of females begins when the doctor says: It's a girl.::Shirley Chisholm
Tremendous amounts of talent are lost to our society just because that talent wears a skirt.::Shirley Chisholm
At present, our country needs women's idealism and determination, perhaps more in politics than anywhere else.::Shirley Chisholm
Sometimes, surely, truth is closer to imagination or to intelligence, to love than to fact? To be accurate is not to be right.::Shirley Hazzard
The role of the teacher remains the highest calling of a free people. To the teacher, America entrusts her most precious resource, her children and asks that they be prepared... to face the rigors of individual participation in a democratic society.::Shirley Hufstedler
After I won the Oscar, my salary doubled, my friends tripled, my children became more popular at school, my butcher made a pass at me, and my maid hit me up for a raise.::Shirley Jones
My goal was not to be famous or rich but to be good at what I did. And that required going to New York and studying and working in the theater.::Shirley Knight
There are things that you cannot talk to your mother and father about, there are things that you cannot talk to your children about.::Shirley Knight
I'm writing a book and working on my one-woman show, Learning To Be Human.::Shirley Knight
The only people you can really share certain things with in secret are your girlfriends.::Shirley Knight
This house was our dream-the gardens, the study, even the swimming pool. Even though I can't see John when I wake up in the morning, I can always feel him here with me.::Shirley Knight
I mean, no one asks beauty secrets of me, or 'What size do you wear?' or 'Who's your couturier?' They ask me about really deep things and I love that.::Shirley MacLaine
If anything interferes with my inner peace, I will walk away. Arguments with family members. All that stuff. None of it matters.::Shirley MacLaine
I never would have given up my work to stay home.::Shirley MacLaine
Fear makes strangers of people who would be friends.::Shirley MacLaine
I don't need anyone to rectify my existence. The most profound relationship we will ever have is the one with ourselves.::Shirley MacLaine
Well, success does not mean doing well.::Shirley MacLaine
It's useless to hold a person to anything he says while he's in love, drunk, or running for office.::Shirley MacLaine
Things are done according to money these days.::Shirley MacLaine
It's a big deal for me to say I'm over politics.::Shirley MacLaine
I can't advise any of the young ones, because I don't know what their background was, but I would suggest that anyone who wants to be famous more than anything - there's a real problem.::Shirley MacLaine
I'd like to introduce someone who has just come into my life. I've admired him for 35 years. He's someone who represents integrity, honesty, art, and on top of that stuff I'm actually sleeping with him.::Shirley MacLaine
Someday perhaps change will occur when times are ready for it instead of always when it is too late. Someday change will be accepted as life itself.::Shirley MacLaine
The soul is everlasting, and its learning experience is lifetime after lifetime.::Shirley MacLaine
The more I traveled the more I realized that fear makes strangers of people who should be friends.::Shirley MacLaine
I've gotten crankier in my old age.::Shirley MacLaine
I want women to be liberated and still be able to have a nice ass and shake it.::Shirley MacLaine
Women being pitted each other another in Hollywood is an old tactic, but it's not real at all.::Shirley MacLaine
I've made so many movies playing a hooker that they don't pay me in the regular way anymore. They leave it on the dresser.::Shirley MacLaine
I wasn't afraid of getting old, because I was never a great beauty.::Shirley MacLaine
We need proof in our society.::Shirley MacLaine
Remember, I come from such an excessively overdone, red-carpet place called Hollywood. So I'm used to people blowing up their success in ways that are far above and beyond the truth.::Shirley MacLaine
When a child comes in, I believe that it's a 'multipersonhood,' and it knows it, its consciousness knows it, and it has a nuclei in the center of its consciousness that is the repository of all experience and all knowledge. And when you look in the eyes of your baby and you feel this sense that they are an old soul, I believe indeed they are.::Shirley MacLaine
Women love working together. That's my experience anyway.::Shirley MacLaine
I stopped believing in Santa Claus when I was six. Mother took me to see him in a department store and he asked for my autograph.::Shirley Temple
An illness is like a journey into a far country it sifts all one's experience and removes it to a point so remote that it appears like a vision.::Sholem Asch
Comedy has to be based on truth. You take the truth and you put a little curlicue at the end.::Sid Caesar
Nevertheless, as is a frequent occurrence in science, a general hypothesis was constructed from a few specific instances of a phenomenon.::Sidney Altman
My intention was to enroll at McGill University but an unexpected series of events led me to study physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.::Sidney Altman
For our immediate family and relatives, Canada was a land of opportunity.::Sidney Altman
Students rarely disappoint teachers who assure them in advance that they are doomed to failure.::Sidney Hook
Everyone who remembers his own education remembers teachers, not methods and techniques. The teacher is the heart of the educational system.::Sidney Hook
Wisdom is a kind of knowledge. It is knowledge of the nature, career, and consequences of human values.::Sidney Hook
Music is love in search of a word.::Sidney Lanier
If you want to be found stand where the seeker seeks.::Sidney Lanier
Virtues are acquired through endeavor, which rests wholly upon yourself.::Sidney Lanier
So I'm OK with myself, with history, my work, who I am and who I was.::Sidney Poitier
I had to satisfy the action fans, the romantic fans, the intellectual fans. It was a terrific burden.::Sidney Poitier
So I had to be careful. I recognized the responsibility that, whether I liked it or not, I had to accept whatever the obligation was. That was to behave in a manner, to carry myself in such a professional way, as if there ever is a reflection, it's a positive one.::Sidney Poitier
I wouldn't change a single thing, because one change alters every moment that follows it.::Sidney Poitier
To simply wake up every morning a better person than when I went to bed.::Sidney Poitier
I know how easy it is for one to stay well within moral, ethical, and legal bounds through the skillful use of words - and to thereby spin, sidestep, circumvent, or bend a truth completely out of shape. To that extent, we are all liars on numerous occasions.::Sidney Poitier
I come from a great family. I've seen family life and I know how wonderful, how nurturing, and how wonderful it can be.::Sidney Poitier
History passes the final judgment.::Sidney Poitier
My father was very big on marriage.::Sidney Poitier
My father was the quintessential husband and dad.::Sidney Poitier
But my dad also was a remarkable man, a good person, a principled individual, a man of integrity.::Sidney Poitier
I decided in my life that I would do nothing that did not reflect positively on my father's life.::Sidney Poitier
I love the freedom that the narrative form provides.::Sidney Sheldon
I admire people who are, by nature, kind and fair to others.::Sidney Sheldon
I wanted to make sure that the man who found the genie would not take terrible advantage of her, so he needed to be a person of integrity and honor - which is why I made the male lead an astronaut. The rest, as they say, is history.::Sidney Sheldon
The Dalai Lama. He is a very wise man of great inner peace who believes that happiness is the purpose of our lives. Through his teachings and leadership, he continues to make this world a better place in which to live.::Sidney Sheldon
If there is any secret to my success, I think it's that my characters are very real to me. I feel everything they feel, and therefore I think my readers care about them.::Sidney Sheldon
Dreams are often most profound when they seem the most crazy.::Sigmund Freud
If a man has been his mother's undisputed darling he retains throughout life the triumphant feeling, the confidence in success, which not seldom brings actual success along with it.::Sigmund Freud
I cannot think of any need in childhood as strong as the need for a father's protection.::Sigmund Freud
Love and work are the cornerstones of our humanness.::Sigmund Freud
The psychical, whatever its nature may be, is itself unconscious.::Sigmund Freud
Civilization began the first time an angry person cast a word instead of a rock.::Sigmund Freud
The interpretation of dreams is the royal road to a knowledge of the unconscious activities of the mind.::Sigmund Freud
Religion is an illusion and it derives its strength from the fact that it falls in with our instinctual desires.::Sigmund Freud
Obviously one must hold oneself responsible for the evil impulses of one's dreams. In what other way can one deal with them? Unless the content of the dream rightly understood is inspired by alien spirits, it is part of my own being.::Sigmund Freud
We are never so defensless against suffering as when we love.::Sigmund Freud
One is very crazy when in love.::Sigmund Freud
Analysis does not set out to make pathological reactions impossible, but to give the patient's ego freedom to decide one way or another.::Sigmund Freud
The goal of all life is death.::Sigmund Freud
Just as a cautious businessman avoids investing all his capital in one concern, so wisdom would probably admonish us also not to anticipate all our happiness from one quarter alone.::Sigmund Freud
The great question that has never been answered, and which I have not yet been able to answer, despite my thirty years of research into the feminine soul, is 'What does a woman want?'::Sigmund Freud
Men are strong so long as they represent a strong idea they become powerless when they oppose it.::Sigmund Freud
A man who has been the indisputable favorite of his mother keeps for life the feeling of a conqueror.::Sigmund Freud
America is the most grandiose experiment the world has seen, but, I am afraid, it is not going to be a success.::Sigmund Freud
What a distressing contrast there is between the radiant intelligence of the child and the feeble mentality of the average adult.::Sigmund Freud
Whoever loves becomes humble. Those who love have, so to speak, pawned a part of their narcissism.::Sigmund Freud
If youth knew if age could.::Sigmund Freud
The voice of the intellect is a soft one, but it does not rest until it has gained a hearing.::Sigmund Freud
Love and work... work and love, that's all there is.::Sigmund Freud
Most people do not really want freedom, because freedom involves responsibility, and most people are frightened of responsibility.::Sigmund Freud
What we call happiness in the strictest sense comes from the (preferably sudden) satisfaction of needs which have been dammed up to a high degree.::Sigmund Freud
I have found little that is 'good' about human beings on the whole. In my experience most of them are trash, no matter whether they publicly subscribe to this or that ethical doctrine or to none at all. That is something that you cannot say aloud, or perhaps even think.::Sigmund Freud
Civilized society is perpetually menaced with disintegration through this primary hostility of men towards one another.::Sigmund Freud
Being entirely honest with oneself is a good exercise.::Sigmund Freud
The act of birth is the first experience of anxiety, and thus the source and prototype of the affect of anxiety.::Sigmund Freud
Time spent with cats is never wasted.::Sigmund Freud
Man has, as it were, become a kind of prosthetic God. When he puts on all his auxiliary organs, he is truly magnificent but those organs have not grown on him and they still give him much trouble at times.::Sigmund Freud
Analogies, it is true, decide nothing, but they can make one feel more at home.::Sigmund Freud
The conscious mind may be compared to a fountain playing in the sun and falling back into the great subterranean pool of subconscious from which it rises.::Sigmund Freud
Men are more moral than they think and far more immoral than they can imagine.::Sigmund Freud
I'm not a traditional politician, and I have a sense of humor. I'll try to soften it and become boring, maybe even very boring, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to.::Silvio Berlusconi
The link between my experience as an entrepreneur and that of a politician is all in one word: freedom.::Silvio Berlusconi
The learned are not agreed as to the time when the Gospel of John was written some dating it as early as the year 68, others as late as the year 98 but it is generally conceded to have been written after all the others.::Simon Greenleaf
The foundation of our religion is a basis of fact - the fact of the birth, ministry, miracles, death, resurrection by the Evangelists as having actually occurred, within their own personal knowledge.::Simon Greenleaf
What we now call school training, the pursuit of fixed studies at stated hours under the constant guidance of a teacher, I could scarcely be said to have enjoyed.::Simon Newcomb
My father was the most rational and the most dispassionate of men.::Simon Newcomb
One hardly knows where, in the history of science, to look for an important movement that had its effective start in so pure and simple an accident as that which led to the building of the great Washington telescope, and went on to the discovery of the satellites of Mars.::Simon Newcomb
The result was that, if it happened to clear off after a cloudy evening, I frequently arose from my bed at any hour of the night or morning and walked two miles to the observatory to make some observation included in the programme.::Simon Newcomb

Scholarship was one thing, drudgery another. I very soon concluded that nothing would induce me to read, let alone make notes on, hundreds and hundreds of very, very, very boring books.::Simon Raven
The combination of hatred and technology is the greatest danger threatening mankind.::Simon Wiesenthal
The history of man is the history of crimes, and history can repeat. So information is a defence. Through this we can build, we must build, a defence against repetition.::Simon Wiesenthal
The schools would fail through their silence, the Church through its forgiveness, and the home through the denial and silence of the parents. The new generation has to hear what the older generation refuses to tell it.::Simon Wiesenthal
Humour is the weapon of unarmed people: it helps people who are oppressed to smile at the situation that pains them.::Simon Wiesenthal

The mysteries of faith are degraded if they are made into an object of affirmation and negation, when in reality they should be an object of contemplation.::Simone Weil

If Germany, thanks to Hitler and his successors, were to enslave the European nations and destroy most of the treasures of their past, future historians would certainly pronounce that she had civilized Europe.::Simone Weil
We can only know one thing about God - that he is what we are not. Our wretchedness alone is an image of this. The more we contemplate it, the more we contemplate him.::Simone Weil
Charity. To love human beings in so far as they are nothing. That is to love them as God does.::Simone Weil
Force is as pitiless to the man who possesses it, or thinks he does, as it is to its victims the second it crushes, the first it intoxicates. The truth is, nobody really possesses it.::Simone Weil
A self-respecting nation is ready for anything, including war, except for a renunciation of its option to make war.::Simone Weil

I can, therefore I am.::Simone Weil
Whatever debases the intelligence degrades the entire human being.::Simone Weil
The intelligent man who is proud of his intelligence is like the condemned man who is proud of his large cell.::Simone Weil

Most works of art, like most wines, ought to be consumed in the district of their fabrication.::Simone Weil

What a country calls its vital... interests are not things that help its people live, but things that help it make war.::Simone Weil
Two prisoners whose cells adjoin communicate with each other by knocking on the wall. The wall is the thing which separates them but is also their means of communication. It is the same with us and God. Every separation is a link.::Simone Weil
The only hope of socialism resides in those who have already brought about in themselves, as far as is possible in the society of today, that union between manual and intellectual labor which characterizes the society we are aiming at.::Simone Weil
Attachment is the great fabricator of illusions reality can be attained only by someone who is detached.::Simone Weil

The most important part of teaching is to teach what it is to know.::Simone Weil
A science which does not bring us nearer to God is worthless.::Simone Weil
Humanism was not wrong in thinking that truth, beauty, liberty, and equality are of infinite value, but in thinking that man can get them for himself without grace.::Simone Weil
In itself, homosexuality is as limiting as heterosexuality: the ideal should be to be capable of loving a woman or a man either, a human being, without feeling fear, restraint, or obligation.::Simone de Beauvoir
Society cares for the individual only so far as he is profitable.::Simone de Beauvoir
It is old age, rather than death, that is to be contrasted with life. Old age is life's parody, whereas death transforms life into a destiny: in a way it preserves it by giving it the absolute dimension. Death does away with time.::Simone de Beauvoir
To catch a husband is an art to hold him is a job.::Simone de Beauvoir
Art is an attempt to integrate evil.::Simone de Beauvoir
All oppression creates a state of war.::Simone de Beauvoir
Defending the truth is not something one does out of a sense of duty or to allay guilt complexes, but is a reward in itself.::Simone de Beauvoir
The most mediocre of males feels himself a demigod as compared with women.::Simone de Beauvoir

There are things they tell us that sound good to hear, but when they have accomplished their purpose they will go home and will not try to fulfill our agreements with them.::Sitting Bull
Let us put our minds together and see what life we can make for our children.::Sitting Bull
If I agree to dispose of any part of our land to the white people I would feel guilty of taking food away from our children's mouths, and I do not wish to be that mean.::Sitting Bull
Behold, my friends, the spring is come the earth has gladly received the embraces of the sun, and we shall soon see the results of their love!::Sitting Bull
What white man can say I never stole his land or a penny of his money? Yet they say that I am a thief.::Sitting Bull
It is through this mysterious power that we too have our being, and we therefore yield to our neighbors, even to our animal neighbors, the same right as ourselves to inhabit this vast land.::Sitting Bull
Success in almost any field depends more on energy and drive than it does on intelligence. This explains why we have so many stupid leaders.::Sloan Wilson
War is just a racket... I believe in adequate defense at the coastline and nothing else.::Smedley Butler
War is a racket. It is the only one international in scope. It is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives.::Smedley Butler
There are only two things we should fight for. One is the defense of our homes and the other is the Bill of Rights.::Smedley Butler

By all means, marry. If you get a good wife, you'll become happy if you get a bad one, you'll become a philosopher.::Socrates
Where there is reverence there is fear, but there is not reverence everywhere that there is fear, because fear presumably has a wider extension than reverence.::Socrates
My advice to you is get married: if you find a good wife you'll be happy if not, you'll become a philosopher.::Socrates
Employ your time in improving yourself by other men's writings, so that you shall gain easily what others have labored hard for.::Socrates
Ordinary people seem not to realize that those who really apply themselves in the right way to philosophy are directly and of their own accord preparing themselves for dying and death.::Socrates
I decided that it was not wisdom that enabled poets to write their poetry, but a kind of instinct or inspiration, such as you find in seers and prophets who deliver all their sublime messages without knowing in the least what they mean.::Socrates
As to marriage or celibacy, let a man take which course he will, he will be sure to repent.::Socrates

Education is the silver bullet to improve this Nation's standing worldwide... and our teachers know that.::Solomon Ortiz
The Peace Corps is an outstanding organization that promotes peace through helping countless individuals who want to help build a better life for the community in which they serve.::Solomon Ortiz
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Peace Corps as it reached its 45th anniversary on March 1, 2006.::Solomon Ortiz
To honor our national promise to our veterans, we must continue to improve services for our men and women in uniform today and provide long overdue benefits for the veterans and military retirees who have already served.::Solomon Ortiz
In addition to serving overseas, the Peace Corps' Crisis Corps Volunteers have helped their fellow Americans.::Solomon Ortiz
Education should be one of our top funding priorities talking about it does not help the teachers and students who desperately need promises fulfilled.::Solomon Ortiz
Education is the key to success in life, and teachers make a lasting impact in the lives of their students.::Solomon Ortiz

Rich people without wisdom and learning are but sheep with golden fleeces.::Solon
I grow old learning something new every day.::Solon
What we have most to fear is failure of the heart.::Sonia Johnson
Obviously, the anti-ERA people are tickled about my ordeal because it proves that the ERA breaks up families. When they point out that feminism is a dangerous thing, I just say marriage is pretty precarious too.::Sonia Johnson
A friend said to me, 'Be glad for your troubles - they strengthen you.' Well, if that's the truth, I'm going to be so strong they'll have to beat me to death!::Sonia Johnson
I'm not a lawyer, and maybe I should have used more specific legal language.::Sonny Bono
Don't cling to fame. You're just borrowing it. It's like money. You're going to die, and somebody else is going to get it.::Sonny Bono
With all due respect to lawyers, it's wonderful that you have this intricate knowledge. You break down words to the nth degree. And sometimes I find it rather disgusting. And it goes on and on.::Sonny Bono
So I went out and bought Hard Again by Muddy Waters. That was a big learning curve. I listened to that album again and again and again. James Cotton was the harmonica player on that album.::Sonny Terry

Spaghetti can be eaten most successfully if you inhale it like a vacuum cleaner.::Sophia Loren
Getting ahead in a difficult profession requires avid faith in yourself. That is why some people with mediocre talent, but with great inner drive, go so much further than people with vastly superior talent.::Sophia Loren
When you are a mother, you are never really alone in your thoughts. A mother always has to think twice, once for herself and once for her child.::Sophia Loren
Beauty is how you feel inside, and it reflects in your eyes. It is not something physical.::Sophia Loren
Many people think they want things, but they don't really have the strength, the discipline. They are weak. I believe that you get what you want if you want it badly enough.::Sophia Loren

Not even old age knows how to love death.::Sophocles
The keenest sorrow is to recognize ourselves as the sole cause of all our adversities.::Sophocles
For death is not the worst, but when one wants to die and is not able even to have that.::Sophocles

Best to live lightly, unthinkingly.::Sophocles
A man growing old becomes a child again.::Sophocles
Success is dependent on effort.::Sophocles

All is disgust when a man leaves his own nature and does what is unfit.::Sophocles
Silence is an ornament for women.::Sophocles

Wisdom outweighs any wealth.::Sophocles
If you were to offer a thirsty man all wisdom, you would not please him more than if you gave him a drink.::Sophocles
I only had a high school education and believe me, I had to cheat to get that.::Sparky Anderson
People who live in the past generally are afraid to compete in the present. I've got my faults, but living in the past is not one of them. There's no future in it.::Sparky Anderson

Hidden nature is secret God.::Sri Aurobindo
That which we call the Hindu religion is really the Eternal religion because it embraces all others.::Sri Aurobindo
India is the meeting place of the religions and among these Hinduism alone is by itself a vast and complex thing, not so much a religion as a great diversified and yet subtly unified mass of spiritual thought, realization and aspiration.::Sri Aurobindo
India saw from the beginning, and, even in her ages of reason and her age of increasing ignorance, she never lost hold of the insight, that life cannot be rightly seen in the sole light, cannot be perfectly lived in the sole power of its externalities.::Sri Aurobindo
She saw too that man has the power of exceeding himself, of becoming himself more entirely and profoundly than he is, truths which have only recently begun to be seen in Europe and seem even now too great for its common intelligence.::Sri Aurobindo
If we know the divine art of concentration, if we know the divine art of meditation, if we know the divine art of contemplation, easily and consciously we can unite the inner world and the outer world.::Sri Chinmoy
Mysticism, poor mysticism! When it is underestimated and oversimplified, it comes down from its original sphere and stands beside religion.::Sri Chinmoy
Productive power is the foundation of a country's economic strength.::Stafford Cripps

Whether or not we believe in survival of consciousness after death, reincarnation, and karma, it has very serious implications for our behavior.::Stanislav Grof
Dying before dying has two important consequences: It liberates the individual from the fear of death and influences the actual experience of dying at the time of biological demise.::Stanislav Grof
There is an urgent need for a radical revision of our current concepts of the nature of consciousness and its relationship to matter and the brain.::Stanislav Grof
There is no fundamental difference between the preparation for death and the practice of dying, and spiritual practice leading to enlightenment.::Stanislav Grof
The beliefs concerning reincarnation have great ethical impact on human life and our relationship to the world.::Stanislav Grof
At a time when unbridled greed, malignant aggression, and existence of weapons of mass destruction threatens the survival of humanity, we should seriously consider any avenue that offers some hope.::Stanislav Grof
I read Freud's Introductory Lectures in Psychoanalysis in basically one sitting. I decided to enroll in medical school. It was almost like a conversion experience.::Stanislav Grof

For any culture which is primarily concerned with meaning, the study of death - the only certainty that life holds for us - must be central, for an understanding of death is the key to liberation in life.::Stanislav Grof
I believe it is essential for our planetary future to develop tools that can change the consciousness which has created the crisis that we are in.::Stanislav Grof
The knowledge of the realm of death makes it possible for the shaman to move freely back and forth and mediate these journeys for other people.::Stanislav Grof
The motif of death plays an important role the human psyche in connection with archetypal and karmic material.::Stanislav Grof
Traditional academic science describes human beings as highly developed animals and biological thinking machines. We appear to be Newtonian objects made of atoms, molecules, cells, tissues, and organs.::Stanislav Grof
The elimination of the fear of death transforms the individual's way of being in the world.::Stanislav Grof
Coming to terms with the fear of death is conducive to healing, positive personality transformation, and consciousness evolution.::Stanislav Grof
Research challenges the materialistic understanding of death, according to which biological death represents the final end of existence and of all conscious activity.::Stanislav Grof
Individuals approaching death often experience encounters with their dead relatives, who seem to welcome them to the next world. These deathbed visions are authentic and convincing they are often followed by a state of euphoria and seem to ease the transition.::Stanislav Grof
The study of consciousness that can extend beyond the body is extremely important for the issue of survival, since it is this part of human personality that would be likely to survive death.::Stanislav Grof
A number of cases have been reported in which a dying individual has a vision of a person about whose death he or she did not know.::Stanislav Grof
The experiences associated with death were seen as visits to important dimensions of reality that deserved to be experienced, studied, and carefully mapped.::Stanislav Grof
I spent much of my later childhood and adolescence very, very involved and interested in art, and particularly in animated movies.::Stanislav Grof
The materialistic paradigm of Western science has been a major obstacle for any objective evaluation of the data describing the events occurring at the time of death.::Stanislav Grof
In the kind of world we have today, transformation of humanity might well be our only real hope for survival.::Stanislav Grof
A text of Tibetan Buddhism describes the time of death as a unique opportunity for spiritual liberation from the cycles of death and rebirth and a period that determines our next incarnation.::Stanislav Grof
An important consequence of freeing oneself from the fear of death is a radical opening to spirituality of a universal and non-denominational type.::Stanislav Grof
According to materialistic science, any memory requires a material substrate, such as the neuronal network in the brain or the DNA molecules of the genes.::Stanislav Grof
I am one of those who would rather sink with faith than swim without it.::Stanley Baldwin
You will find in politics that you are much exposed to the attribution of false motive. Never complain and never explain.::Stanley Baldwin
I would rather trust a woman's instinct than a man's reason.::Stanley Baldwin
A statesman wants courage and a statesman wants vision but believe me, after six months' experience, he wants first, second, third and all the time - patience.::Stanley Baldwin
War would end if the dead could return.::Stanley Baldwin
Belief and knowledge are considered to be two different things. But they are not.::Stanley Fish
The screen is a magic medium. It has such power that it can retain interest as it conveys emotions and moods that no other art form can hope to tackle.::Stanley Kubrick
A film is - or should be - more like music than like fiction. It should be a progression of moods and feelings. The theme, what's behind the emotion, the meaning, all that comes later.::Stanley Kubrick
The great nations have always acted like gangsters, and the small nations like prostitutes.::Stanley Kubrick

A filmmaker has almost the same freedom as a novelist has when he buys himself some paper.::Stanley Kubrick

Art, in itself, is an attempt to bring order out of chaos.::Stephen Sondheim
I'm interested in the theater because I'm interested in communication with audiences. Otherwise I would be in concert music.::Stephen Sondheim

It's hard to say what drives a three year-old, but I think I had a sense that nature was my solace, and nature was a place in which there was beauty, in which there was order.::Story Musgrave
I've already written 300 space poems. But I look upon my ultimate form as being a poetic prose. When you read it, it appears to be prose, but within the prose you have embedded the techniques of poetry.::Story Musgrave
When you're looking that far out, you're giving people their place in the universe, it touches people. Science is often visual, so it doesn't need translation. It's like poetry, it touches you.::Story Musgrave

I hope for peace and sanity - it's the same thing.::Studs Terkel
Nonetheless, do I have respect for people who believe in the hereafter? Of course I do. I might add, perhaps even a touch of envy too, because of the solace.::Studs Terkel
If solace is any sort of succor to someone, that is sufficient. I believe in the faith of people, whatever faith they may have.::Studs Terkel
I'm not up on the Internet, but I hear that is a democratic possibility. People can connect with each other. I think people are ready for something, but there is no leadership to offer it to them. People are ready to say, 'Yes, we are part of a world.'::Studs Terkel
We use the word 'hope' perhaps more often than any other word in the vocabulary: 'I hope it's a nice day.' 'Hopefully, you're doing well.' 'So how are things going along? Pretty good. Going to be good tomorrow? Hope so.'::Studs Terkel
People are ready to say, 'Yes, we are ready for single-payer health insurance.' We are the only industrialized country in the world that does not have national health insurance. We are the richest in wealth and the poorest in health of all the industrial nations.::Studs Terkel
I think it's realistic to have hope. One can be a perverse idealist and say the easiest thing: 'I despair. The world's no good.' That's a perverse idealist. It's practical to hope, because the hope is for us to survive as a human species. That's very realistic.::Studs Terkel
Religion obviously played a role in this book and the previous book, too.::Studs Terkel
I've always felt, in all my books, that there's a deep decency in the American people and a native intelligence - providing they have the facts, providing they have the information.::Studs Terkel
I want, of course, peace, grace, and beauty. How do you do that? You work for it.::Studs Terkel
With optimism, you look upon the sunny side of things. People say, 'Studs, you're an optimist.' I never said I was an optimist. I have hope because what's the alternative to hope? Despair? If you have despair, you might as well put your head in the oven.::Studs Terkel
That's why I wrote this book: to show how these people can imbue us with hope. I read somewhere that when a person takes part in community action, his health improves. Something happens to him or to her biologically. It's like a tonic.::Studs Terkel
Americans are a decade behind Canada when it comes to sex education and understanding their bodies.::Sue Johanson
Sex is... perfectly natural. It's something that's pleasurable. It's enjoyable and it enhances a relationship. So why don't we learn as much as we can about it and become comfortable with ourselves as sexual human beings because we are all sexual?::Sue Johanson
It's sad that the most glorious of sexual experiences can make us feel guilty, ashamed, embarrassed, and abnormal.::Sue Johanson
The growth of Stewart Airport creates new jobs for area residents, brings new business and new travelers to the region, and brings new convenient travel options to those of us living in the Hudson Valley.::Sue Kelly

Success is not built on success. It's built on failure. It's built on frustration. Sometimes its built on catastrophe.::Sumner Redstone
In my opinion, if we have not achieved peace, it is because people forget its most fundamental aspect. Before we talk about peace among nations, we must settle our peace with God.::Sun Myung Moon
I created the Women's Federation for World Peace in order to restore all that woman originally lost. You American women don't need a man in the position of grandfather, parents, husband, elder or younger brother. You only need the true Adam.::Sun Myung Moon
The day will come, however, when they will truly know the Unification Church and me. The day will come when the truth will be known and the message of love will be taught. On that day, their regret will be deep.::Sun Myung Moon
A member must say that he is a member of the Unification Church and that he is the follower of Sun Myung Moon. If he doesn't have the courage to say it, he is not worthy of me.::Sun Myung Moon
Throughout history no one has suffered more than God. He has suffered because his own children fell away from him. Ever since the Fall, God has been working tirelessly for the restoration of mankind. People do not know this brokenhearted aspect of God.::Sun Myung Moon
My mission is a cosmic mission. My concern is for all of humanity, and not only this present world, but the world hereafter. My mission penetrates the past, present, and future, and encompasses all humanity.::Sun Myung Moon
I served the famous professors and scholars, and eventually they learned that the Reverend Moon is superior to them. Even Nobel laureate academics who thought they were at the center of knowledge are as nothing in front of me.::Sun Myung Moon
But recently I began to feel that maybe I wouldn't be able to do what I want to do and need to do with American musicians, who are imprisoned behind these bars music's got these bars and measures you know.::Sun Ra
All war is deception.::Sun Tzu
The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.::Sun Tzu
It is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who will use the highest intelligence of the army for the purposes of spying, and thereby they achieve great results.::Sun Tzu
Can you imagine what I would do if I could do all I can?::Sun Tzu
The enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good general full of caution.::Sun Tzu
He who is prudent and lies in wait for an enemy who is not, will be victorious.::Sun Tzu
Now the reason the enlightened prince and the wise general conquer the enemy whenever they move and their achievements surpass those of ordinary men is foreknowledge.::Sun Tzu
If you know the enemy and know yourself you need not fear the results of a hundred battles.::Sun Tzu
There has never been a protracted war from which a country has benefited.::Sun Tzu
Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you into the deepest valleys look on them as your own beloved sons, and they will stand by you even unto death.::Sun Tzu
In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good.::Sun Tzu
Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win.::Sun Tzu
All men can see these tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved.::Sun Tzu
The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace, whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.::Sun Tzu
If our soldiers are not overburdened with money, it is not because they have a distaste for riches if their lives are not unduly long, it is not because they are disinclined to longevity.::Sun Tzu
If we know that our own men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the enemy is not open to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory.::Sun Tzu
Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.::Sun Tzu
The skilful employer of men will employ the wise man, the brave man, the covetous man, and the stupid man.::Sun Tzu
The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.::Sun Tzu
Secret operations are essential in war: upon them the army relies to make its every move.::Sun Tzu
Thus, what is of supreme importance in war is to attack the enemy's strategy.::Sun Tzu
Prohibit the taking of omens, and do away with superstitious doubts. Then, until death itself comes, no calamity need be feared.::Sun Tzu
If all the rich and all of the church people should send their children to the public schools they would feel bound to concentrate their money on improving these schools until they met the highest ideals.::Susan B. Anthony
Trust me that as I ignore all law to help the slave, so will I ignore it all to protect an enslaved woman.::Susan B. Anthony

Organize, agitate, educate, must be our war cry.::Susan B. Anthony
I have encountered riotous mobs and have been hung in effigy, but my motto is: Men's rights are nothing more. Women's rights are nothing less.::Susan B. Anthony
I distrust those people who know so well what God wants them to do, because I notice it always coincides with their own desires.::Susan B. Anthony
I do not consider divorce an evil by any means. It is just as much a refuge for women married to brutal men as Canada was to the slaves of brutal masters.::Susan B. Anthony
Women, we might as well be dogs baying the moon as petitioners without the right to vote!::Susan B. Anthony
The older I get, the greater power I seem to have to help the world I am like a snowball - the further I am rolled the more I gain.::Susan B. Anthony

I do a lot of work with the Dyslexia Institute because, for people with dyslexia who do not have parental support, it is a huge disadvantage. I was fortunate because my Mum was a teacher and she taught me to work hard.::Susan Hampshire
The becoming of man is the history of the exhaustion of his possibilities.::Susan Sontag
To take a photograph is to participate in another person's mortality, vulnerability, mutability. Precisely by slicing out this moment and freezing it, all photographs testify to time's relentless melt.::Susan Sontag
What is the most beautiful in virile men is something feminine what is most beautiful in feminine women is something masculine.::Susan Sontag
A family's photograph album is generally about the extended family and, often, is all that remains of it.::Susan Sontag
Anything in history or nature that can be described as changing steadily can be seen as heading toward catastrophe.::Susan Sontag
Intelligence is really a kind of taste: taste in ideas.::Susan Sontag
For those who live neither with religious consolations about death nor with a sense of death (or of anything else) as natural, death is the obscene mystery, the ultimate affront, the thing that cannot be controlled. It can only be denied.::Susan Sontag
Existence is no more than the precarious attainment of relevance in an intensely mobile flux of past, present, and future.::Susan Sontag
Science fiction films are not about science. They are about disaster, which is one of the oldest subjects of art.::Susan Sontag
Volume depends precisely on the writer's having been able to sit in a room every day, year after year, alone.::Susan Sontag
Authoritarian political ideologies have a vested interest in promoting fear, a sense of the imminence of takeover by aliens and real diseases are useful material.::Susan Sontag
Any critic is entitled to wrong judgments, of course. But certain lapses of judgment indicate the radical failure of an entire sensibility.::Susan Sontag
I do not think white America is committed to granting equality to the American Negro. This is a passionately racist country it will continue to be so in the foreseeable future.::Susan Sontag
Books are funny little portable pieces of thought.::Susan Sontag
The love of the famous, like all strong passions, is quite abstract. Its intensity can be measured mathematically, and it is independent of persons.::Susan Sontag
The aim of all commentary on art now should be to make works of art - and, by analogy, our own experience - more, rather than less, real to us. The function of criticism should be to show how it is what it is, even that it is what it is, rather than to show what it means.::Susan Sontag
I was not looking for my dreams to interpret my life, but rather for my life to interpret my dreams.::Susan Sontag
The truth is balance. However the opposite of truth, which is unbalance, may not be a lie.::Susan Sontag
Interpretation is the revenge of the intellectual upon art.::Susan Sontag
Most people in this society who aren't actively mad are, at best, reformed or potential lunatics.::Susan Sontag
The past itself, as historical change continues to accelerate, has become the most surreal of subjects - making it possible... to see a new beauty in what is vanishing.::Susan Sontag
Travel becomes a strategy for accumulating photographs.::Susan Sontag
A relationship is lovely if you're happy, comfortable in it and you really like the person. I can think of nothing better. But there's nothing worse than having a relationship in which you feel no interest.::Susannah York
I feel I'd like to share my luck and my life. Being in love is the best thing in the world.::Susannah York
Seeing the family is a very important part of my weekend.::Susannah York
If we would have new knowledge, we must get a whole world of new questions.::Susanne Langer
The more we come out and do good to others, the more our hearts will be purified, and God will be in them.::Swami Vivekananda
Our duty is to encourage every one in his struggle to live up to his own highest idea, and strive at the same time to make the ideal as near as possible to the Truth.::Swami Vivekananda
Truth can be stated in a thousand different ways, yet each one can be true.::Swami Vivekananda
Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life - think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success.::Swami Vivekananda
The moment I have realized God sitting in the temple of every human body, the moment I stand in reverence before every human being and see God in him - that moment I am free from bondage, everything that binds vanishes, and I am free.::Swami Vivekananda

God is to be worshipped as the one beloved, dearer than everything in this and next life.::Swami Vivekananda
We are what our thoughts have made us so take care about what you think. Words are secondary. Thoughts live they travel far.::Swami Vivekananda
May He who is the Brahman of the Hindus, the Ahura-Mazda of the Zoroastrians, the Buddha of the Buddhists, the Jehovah of the Jews, the Father in Heaven of the Christians give strength to you to carry out your noble idea.::Swami Vivekananda
If faith in ourselves had been more extensively taught and practiced, I am sure a very large portion of the evils and miseries that we have would have vanished.::Swami Vivekananda

The world is the great gymnasium where we come to make ourselves strong.::Swami Vivekananda
If money help a man to do good to others, it is of some value but if not, it is simply a mass of evil, and the sooner it is got rid of, the better.::Swami Vivekananda
The Vedanta recognizes no sin it only recognizes error. And the greatest error, says the Vedanta is to say that you are weak, that you are a sinner, a miserable creature, and that you have no power and you cannot do this and that.::Swami Vivekananda
You cannot believe in God until you believe in yourself.::Swami Vivekananda
External nature is only internal nature writ large.::Swami Vivekananda
Where can we go to find God if we cannot see Him in our own hearts and in every living being.::Swami Vivekananda
In my second year, after moving to the Medical School, I began the courses of Anatomy and Physiology. I had begun to see that I was interested in cells and their functions.::Sydney Brenner

Men make counterfeit money in many more cases, money makes counterfeit men.::Sydney J. Harris
Our dilemma is that we hate change and love it at the same time what we really want is for things to remain the same but get better.::Sydney J. Harris
The two words 'information' and 'communication' are often used interchangeably, but they signify quite different things. Information is giving out communication is getting through.::Sydney J. Harris
Regret for the things we did can be tempered by time it is regret for the things we did not do that is inconsolable.::Sydney J. Harris
The three hardest tasks in the world are neither physical feats nor intellectual achievements, but moral acts: to return love for hate, to include the excluded, and to say, 'I was wrong'.::Sydney J. Harris
The whole purpose of education is to turn mirrors into windows.::Sydney J. Harris
Democracy is the only system that persists in asking the powers that be whether they are the powers that ought to be.::Sydney J. Harris
If a small thing has the power to make you angry, does that not indicate something about your size?::Sydney J. Harris
Almost no one is foolish enough to imagine that he automatically deserves great success in any field of activity yet almost everyone believes that he automatically deserves success in marriage.::Sydney J. Harris
The real danger is not that computers will begin to think like men, but that men will begin to think like computers.::Sydney J. Harris
When I hear somebody sigh, 'Life is hard,' I am always tempted to ask, 'Compared to what?'::Sydney J. Harris
The primary purpose of a liberal education is to make one's mind a pleasant place in which to spend one's leisure.::Sydney J. Harris
The time to relax is when you don't have time for it.::Sydney J. Harris
It's surprising how many persons go through life without ever recognizing that their feelings toward other people are largely determined by their feelings toward themselves, and if you're not comfortable within yourself, you can't be comfortable with others.::Sydney J. Harris
I didn't grow up thinking of movies as film, or art, but as movies, something to do on a Saturday afternoon.::Sydney Pollack
I think it's a terrible shame that politics has become show business.::Sydney Pollack
Every single art form is involved in film, in a way.::Sydney Pollack
The very reasons sometimes that you make a film are the reasons for its failure.::Sydney Pollack
I mean, certainly writing, painting, photography, dance, architecture, there is an aspect of almost every art form that is useful and that merges into film in some way.::Sydney Pollack
When you make a film you usually make a film about an idea.::Sydney Pollack

Everyone dreams, but not everybody remembers their dreams because some people go into delta they go too low.::Sylvia Browne
A spirit is, like, your mother, my dad, who've made it. They can come around, but they come around in a loving way because they've already made it to God. Most people make it.::Sylvia Browne
It's so sad: anything that has to do with God, people want to dispel.::Sylvia Browne
I hope for your help to explore and protect the wild ocean in ways that will restore the health and, in so doing, secure hope for humankind. Health to the ocean means health for us.::Sylvia Earle
Ten percent of the big fish still remain. There are still some blue whales. There are still some krill in Antarctica. There are a few oysters in Chesapeake Bay. Half the coral reefs are still in pretty good shape, a jeweled belt around the middle of the planet. There's still time, but not a lot, to turn things around.::Sylvia Earle
Dying is an art, like everything else. I do it exceptionally well. I do it so it feels like hell. I do it so it feels real. I guess you could say I've a call.::Sylvia Plath
If neurotic is wanting two mutually exclusive things at one and the same time, then I'm neurotic as hell. I'll be flying back and forth between one mutually exclusive thing and another for the rest of my days.::Sylvia Plath
The blood jet is poetry and there is no stopping it.::Sylvia Plath
And by the way, everything in life is writable about if you have the outgoing guts to do it, and the imagination to improvise. The worst enemy to creativity is self-doubt.::Sylvia Plath

If you can provide the funding and you get the leadership, you'll have a competitive team.::T. Boone Pickens

I think I have more patience now than I did in the past.::T. Boone Pickens
I've always believed that it's important to show a new look periodically. Predictability can lead to failure.::T. Boone Pickens
I'm a Republican. I don't want to go to heaven and have to face my family up there and tell them I voted for a Democrat.::T. Boone Pickens
I've been &amp am absurdly over-estimated. There are no supermen &amp I'm quite ordinary, &amp will say so whatever the artistic results. In that point I'm one of the few people who tell the truth about myself.::T. E. Lawrence
All the revision in the world will not save a bad first draft: for the architecture of the thing comes, or fails to come, in the first conception, and revision only affects the detail and ornament, alas!::T. E. Lawrence
Men have looked upon the desert as barren land, the free holding of whoever chose but in fact each hill and valley in it had a man who was its acknowledged owner and would quickly assert the right of his family or clan to it, against aggression.::T. E. Lawrence
It seemed that rebellion must have an unassailable base, something guarded not merely from attack, but from the fear of it: such a base as we had in the Red Sea Parts, the desert, or in the minds of the men we converted to our creed.::T. E. Lawrence
All men dream, but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds, wake in the day to find that it was vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act on their dreams with open eyes, to make them possible.::T. E. Lawrence
Every experience is a paradox in that it means to be absolute, and yet is relative in that it somehow always goes beyond itself and yet never escapes itself.::T. S. Eliot

This love is silent.::T. S. Eliot
Moving between the legs of tables and of chairs, rising or falling, grasping at kisses and toys, advancing boldly, sudden to take alarm, retreating to the corner of arm and knee, eager to be reassured, taking pleasure in the fragrant brilliance of the Christmas tree.::T. S. Eliot
The last thing one discovers in composing a work is what to put first.::T. S. Eliot
Our high respect for a well read person is praise enough for literature.::T. S. Eliot

Where is the Life we have lost in living? Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?::T. S. Eliot
As things are, and as fundamentally they must always be, poetry is not a career, but a mug's game. No honest poet can ever feel quite sure of the permanent value of what he has written: He may have wasted his time and messed up his life for nothing.::T. S. Eliot
The business of the poet is not to find new emotions, but to use the ordinary ones and, in working them up into poetry, to express feelings which are not in actual emotions at all.::T. S. Eliot
Poetry may make us from time to time a little more aware of the deeper, unnamed feelings which form the substratum of our being, to which we rarely penetrate for our lives are mostly a constant evasion of ourselves.::T. S. Eliot
Poetry is not a turning loose of emotion, but an escape from emotion it is not the expression of personality, but an escape from personality. But, of course, only those who have personality and emotions know what it means to want to escape from these things.::T. S. Eliot
Knowledge is invariably a matter of degree: you cannot put your finger upon even the simplest datum and say this we know.::T. S. Eliot
I am an Anglo-Catholic in religion, a classicist in literature and a royalist in politics.::T. S. Eliot
It is only in the world of objects that we have time and space and selves.::T. S. Eliot
The communication of the dead is tongued with fire beyond the language of the living.::T. S. Eliot
All significant truths are private truths. As they become public they cease to become truths they become facts, or at best, part of the public character or at worst, catchwords.::T. S. Eliot
I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope, For hope would be hope for the wrong thing.::T. S. Eliot

Genuine poetry can communicate before it is understood.::T. S. Eliot
Television is a medium of entertainment which permits millions of people to listen to the same joke at the same time, and yet remain lonesome.::T. S. Eliot

A lot has been written about Tony Perkins and myself and I figured, Let's get it straight. I had a relationship with Tony for two to three years, but those are only threads in the tapestry of my whole life.::Tab Hunter
All the things that happen to people in the industry today, the actors, what they have to put up with, all the people wanting to know every single moment of their lives - I think it's really sad.::Tab Hunter
I don't care whether people like me or dislike me. I'm not on earth to win a popularity contest. I'm here to be the best human being I possibly can be.::Tab Hunter
Rock Hudson wasn't my type. He's a great guy and had a great sense of humor.::Tab Hunter
I turned into a workaholic to the point of where my health was in jeopardy.::Tab Hunter
To plunder, to slaughter, to steal, these things they misname empire and where they make a wilderness, they call it peace.::Tacitus
A desire to resist oppression is implanted in the nature of man.::Tacitus
Fear is not in the habit of speaking truth when perfect sincerity is expected, perfect freedom must be allowed nor has anyone who is apt to be angry when he hears the truth any cause to wonder that he does not hear it.::Tacitus
Be assured those will be thy worst enemies, not to whom thou hast done evil, but who have done evil to thee. And those will be thy best friends, not to whom thou hast done good, but who have done good to thee.::Tacitus
A bad peace is even worse than war.::Tacitus
Truth is confirmed by inspection and delay falsehood by haste and uncertainty.::Tacitus
Reason and judgment are the qualities of a leader.::Tacitus
The desire for safety stands against every great and noble enterprise.::Tacitus
Among those who are satisfactory in this respect it is desirable to have represented as great a diversity of intellectual tradition, social milieu and personal character as possible.::Talcott Parsons
The hypothesis may be put forward, to be tested by the s subsequent investigation, that this development has been in large part a matter of the reciprocal interaction of new factual insights and knowledge on the one hand with changes in the theoretical system on the other.::Talcott Parsons
It is that of increasing knowledge of empirical fact, intimately combined with changing interpretations of this body of fact - hence changing general statements about it - and, not least, a changing a structure of the theoretical system.::Talcott Parsons
It is probably safe to say that all the changes of factual knowledge which have led to the relativity theory, resulting in a very great theoretical development, are completely trivial from any point of view except their relevance to the structure of a theoretical system.::Talcott Parsons
The conception that, instead of this, contemporary society is at or near a turning point is very prominent in the views of a school of social scientists who, though they are still comparatively few, are getting more and more of a hearing.::Talcott Parsons
From all this it follows what the general character of the problem of the development of a body of scientific knowledge is, in so far as it depends on elements internal to science itself.::Talcott Parsons
The functions of the family in a highly differentiated society are not to be interpreted as functions directly on behalf of the society, but on behalf of personality.::Talcott Parsons
The implications of these considerations justify the statement that all empirically verifiable knowledge even the commonsense knowledge of everyday life - involves implicitly, if not explicitly, systematic theory in this sense.::Talcott Parsons
But the scientific importance of a change in knowledge of fact consists precisely in j its having consequences for a system of theory.::Talcott Parsons
Television could perform a great service in mass education, but there's no indication its sponsors have anything like this on their minds.::Tallulah Bankhead
The less I behave like Whistler's mother the night before, the more I look like her the morning after.::Tallulah Bankhead
I'll come and make love to you at five o'clock. If I'm late start without me.::Tallulah Bankhead
I have three phobias which, could I mute them, would make my life as slick as a sonnet, but as dull as ditch water: I hate to go to bed, I hate to get up, and I hate to be alone.::Tallulah Bankhead
(On seeing a former lover for the first time in years) I thought I told you to wait in the car.::Tallulah Bankhead
If I had to live my life again, I'd make the same mistakes, only sooner.::Tallulah Bankhead
Only good girls keep diaries. Bad girls don't have time.::Tallulah Bankhead
I read Shakespeare and the Bible, and I can shoot dice. That's what I call a liberal education.::Tallulah Bankhead
The reason for not getting married was that I just didn't have a partner to get married to. Climbing mountains was more attractive to me than marriage, or other fun things like that.::Tamae Watanabe
Learning should be a joy and full of excitement. It is life's greatest adventure it is an illustrated excursion into the minds of the noble and the learned.::Taylor Caldwell
I wanted to acquire an education, work extremely hard and never deviate from my goal, to make it.::Taylor Caldwell

Show respect to all people, but grovel to none.::Tecumseh
When your time comes to die, be not like those whose hearts are filled with fear of death, so that when their time comes they weep and pray for a little more time to live their lives over again in a different way. Sing your death song, and die like a hero going home.::Tecumseh
When you rise in the morning, give thanks for the light, for your life, for your strength. Give thanks for your food and for the joy of living. If you see no reason to give thanks, the fault lies in yourself.::Tecumseh
Always give a word or sign of salute when meeting or passing a friend, or even a stranger, if in a lonely place.::Tecumseh
Live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart.::Tecumseh
A single twig breaks, but the bundle of twigs is strong.::Tecumseh
Prepare a noble death song for the day when you go over the great divide.::Tecumseh
When the legends die, the dreams end there is no more greatness.::Tecumseh
Fishing provides that connection with the whole living world. It gives you the opportunity of being totally immersed, turning back into yourself in a good way. A form of meditation, some form of communion with levels of yourself that are deeper than the ordinary self.::Ted Hughes
A series of rumors about my attitude, as well as derogatory remarks about myself and my family showed me that the personal resentment of the Detroit general manager toward me would make it impossible for me to continue playing hockey in Detroit.::Ted Lindsay
They were saying computers deal with numbers. This was absolutely nonsense. Computers deal with arbitrary information of any kind.::Ted Nelson
The good news about computers is that they do what you tell them to do. The bad news is that they do what you tell them to do.::Ted Nelson
Computers are hierarchical. We have a desktop and hierarchical files which have to mean everything.::Ted Nelson
In my second year in graduate school, I took a computer course and that was like lightening striking.::Ted Nelson
So in my uncertainty, I went to graduate school and there it all happened.::Ted Nelson
I rise today to discuss the National Intelligence Reform bill. I commend my colleagues in both Houses for their hard work in coming to an agreement. As with any conference, each voice is heard, but none can dominate and compromise must be achieved.::Ted Stevens
I do have concerns about the current efforts to restructure our nation's intelligence community.::Ted Stevens
I am not opposed to intelligence reform on its face, but any changes should reflect the current context.::Ted Stevens
War has been good to me from a financial standpoint but I don't want to make money that way. I don't want blood money.::Ted Turner
I've had the good fortune to have a much more diverse life than most people would, professional sports and television and news and movies.::Ted Turner
My son is now an 'entrepreneur.' That's what you're called when you don't have a job.::Ted Turner

Life is a game. Money is how we keep score.::Ted Turner

Baseball's future? Bigger and bigger, better and better! No question about it, it's the greatest game there is!::Ted Williams
The future is called 'perhaps,' which is the only possible thing to call the future. And the important thing is not to allow that to scare you.::Tennessee Williams
I have always been pushed by the negative. The apparent failure of a play sends me back to my typewriter that very night, before the reviews are out. I am more compelled to get back to work than if I had a success.::Tennessee Williams
Death is one moment, and life is so many of them.::Tennessee Williams
All good art is an indiscretion.::Tennessee Williams
All of us are guinea pigs in the laboratory of God. Humanity is just a work in progress.::Tennessee Williams

Success and failure are equally disastrous.::Tennessee Williams
The violets in the mountains have broken the rocks.::Tennessee Williams
Time is the longest distance between two places.::Tennessee Williams
We're all of us guinea pigs in the laboratory of God. Humanity is just a work in progress.::Tennessee Williams

You can be young without money but you can't be old without it.::Tennessee Williams

I was using tape loops for dancers and dance production. I had very funky primitive equipment, in fact technology wasn't very good no matter how much money you had.::Terry Riley
Music can also be a sensual pleasure, like eating food or sex. But its highest vibration for me is that point of taking us to a real understanding of something in our nature which we can very rarely get at. It is a spiritual state of oneness.::Terry Riley
Television contracts the imagination and radio expands it.::Terry Wogan
The nature of rumor is known to all.::Tertullian
Truth engenders hatred of truth. As soon as it appears, it is the enemy.::Tertullian

Well, I think the president is going to do well in terms of his influence for positive change here in the Congress, making sure that we don't overspend, making sure that we spend for only those programs that are justified.::Thad Cochran
We have an opportunity, but we have an obligation to senior citizens and to the younger people who are entering the workforce today to help ensure that they are going to be able to trust the government to have a workable program that benefits them as well.::Thad Cochran
With a recent birthday, I've been acting now for twenty years.::Thayer David
What We want is to make it possible for our unfortunate people to live a life of industry for it is by steady work alone that we hope for our physical and moral rehabilitation. For this reason above all we have undertaken to rally our people around our ideal.::Theodor Herzl
It goes without saying that the Jewish people can have no other goal than Palestine and that, whatever the fate of the proposition may be, our attitude toward the land of our fathers is and shall remain unchangeable.::Theodor Herzl
We believe that salvation is to be found in wholesome work in a beloved land. Work will provide our people with the bread of tomorrow, and moreover, with the honor of the tomorrow, the freedom of the tomorrow.::Theodor Herzl
Philanthropic colonization is a failure. National colonization will succeed.::Theodor Herzl

You can't expect the entire world to come to New York to see you. You have to travel to them.::Theodore Bikel

In my mind the city of Ariel is a thorn in Israel's side and a serious obstacle to peace.::Theodore Bikel
In my world, history comes down to language and art. No one cares much about what battles were fought, who won them and who lost them - unless there is a painting, a play, a song or a poem that speaks of the event.::Theodore Bikel
Having come to live in this age is as though one were to have entered another country. Learn its language or risk being left out.::Theodore Bikel

People ask the difference between a leader and a boss. The leader leads, and the boss drives.::Theodore Roosevelt
The only time you really live fully is from thirty to sixty. The young are slaves to dreams the old servants of regrets. Only the middle-aged have all their five senses in the keeping of their wits.::Theodore Roosevelt
Believe you can and you're halfway there.::Theodore Roosevelt
Rhetoric is a poor substitute for action, and we have trusted only to rhetoric. If we are really to be a great nation, we must not merely talk we must act big.::Theodore Roosevelt
Old age is like everything else. To make a success of it, you've got to start young.::Theodore Roosevelt
Never throughout history has a man who lived a life of ease left a name worth remembering.::Theodore Roosevelt
Far better is it to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs, even though checkered by failure... than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy nor suffer much, because they live in a gray twilight that knows not victory nor defeat.::Theodore Roosevelt

But there comes a moment in everybody's life when he must decide whether he'll live among the human beings or not - a fool among fools or a fool alone.::Thornton Wilder
Love is an energy which exists of itself. It is its own value.::Thornton Wilder
Providence has nothing good or high in store for one who does not resolutely aim at something high or good. A purpose is the eternal condition of success.::Thornton Wilder
The addiction to sports, therefore, in a peculiar degree marks an arrested development in man's moral nature.::Thorstein Veblen
Labor wants pride and joy in doing good work, a sense of making or doing something beautiful or useful - to be treated with dignity and respect as brother and sister.::Thorstein Veblen
The basis on which good repute in any highly organized industrial community ultimately rests is pecuniary strength and the means of showing pecuniary strength, and so of gaining or retaining a good name, are leisure and a conspicuous consumption of goods.::Thorstein Veblen
The secret to happiness is freedom... And the secret to freedom is courage.::Thucydides
Wars spring from unseen and generally insignificant causes, the first outbreak being often but an explosion of anger.::Thucydides
Be convinced that to be happy means to be free and that to be free means to be brave. Therefore do not take lightly the perils of war.::Thucydides
Men's indignation, it seems, is more excited by legal wrong than by violent wrong the first looks like being cheated by an equal, the second like being compelled by a superior.::Thucydides
Ignorance is bold and knowledge reserved.::Thucydides
History is Philosophy teaching by example.::Thucydides
Men naturally despise those who court them, but respect those who do not give way to them.::Thucydides
If the First Amendment means anything, it means that a state has no business telling a man, sitting alone in his house, what books he may read or what films he may watch.::Thurgood Marshall
None of us got where we are solely by pulling ourselves up by our bootstraps. We got here because somebody - a parent, a teacher, an Ivy League crony or a few nuns - bent down and helped us pick up our boots.::Thurgood Marshall
Today's Constitution is a realistic document of freedom only because of several corrective amendments. Those amendments speak to a sense of decency and fairness that I and other Blacks cherish.::Thurgood Marshall
Our whole constitutional heritage rebels at the thought of giving government the power to control men's minds.::Thurgood Marshall
Sometimes history takes things into its own hands.::Thurgood Marshall
Let them hate me, provided they respect my conduct.::Tiberius
As a kid I was short and only weighed 95 pounds. And though I was active in a lot of Sports and got along with most of the guys, I think I used comedy as a defense mechanism. You know making someone laugh is a much better way to solve a problem than by using your fists.::Tim Conway
My advice to people today is as follows: if you take the game of life seriously, if you take your nervous system seriously, if you take your sense organs seriously, if you take the energy process seriously, you must turn on, tune in, and drop out.::Timothy Leary
You're only as young as the last time you changed your mind.::Timothy Leary
The universe is an intelligence test.::Timothy Leary
Civilization is unbearable, but it is less unbearable at the top.::Timothy Leary

We are dealing with the best-educated generation in history. But they've got a brain dressed up with nowhere to go.::Timothy Leary
In the information age, you don't teach philosophy as they did after feudalism. You perform it. If Aristotle were alive today he'd have a talk show.::Timothy Leary
Science is all metaphor.::Timothy Leary
The newly decorated theatres produced things like car parks and restaurants, so you could have a good night out, quite cheaply without all that bother of having to go somewhere else.::Timothy West
I concentrate on exercises from the waist down, since that is the laziest part of a woman's body.::Tina Louise
Mental communication without verbalization... all space is made up of waves and we are constantly sending and receiving messages from our brain.::Tina Louise
I never close a door on any other religion. Most of the time, some part of it makes sense to me. I don't believe everyone has to chant just because I chant. I believe all religion is about touching something inside of yourself.::Tina Turner
I regret not having had more time with my kids when they were growing up.::Tina Turner
I was always attracted to science fiction movies.::Tina Turner
Physical strength in a woman - that's what I am.::Tina Turner
I'm not wise, but the beginning of wisdom is there it's like relaxing into - and an acceptance of - things.::Tina Turner
For me the goddess is the female of God, She is powerful if different.::Tina Turner
Movies are movies: they take you back in time, and how it still is for some.::Tina Turner
Working with Chaplin was very amusing and strange. His films are so funny, but working with him, I found him to be a very serious man. Whereas the films of Hitchcock are macabre, he could be a very funny man to work with, always telling jokes and holding court. Of course, when I worked with Charlie he was getting older.::Tippi Hedren
So I think it is common knowledge that Hitchcock had fantasies or whatever you want to call them about his leading ladies.::Tippi Hedren
So I do have to work, you know, and I find as many movies and TV shows that I can, because otherwise I wouldn't have an income.::Tippi Hedren
Honest to God, all my life I have had such a fear of spiders. In fact, I use to have a reoccurring dream about one. Very clearly, it was black with a red head. It would sit up in the corner of the bedroom and when it started getting closer, I would wake up in a panic.::Tippi Hedren
One lion thinks it's just hilarious to tackle us. He's very funny about it... and we always know when it will happen.::Tippi Hedren
Hitchcock had a charm about him. He was very funny at times. He was incredibly brilliant in his field of suspense.::Tippi Hedren
I was at the end of the studio system so when I walked into movies, I had a magnificent suite in which I had a living room and a kitchen and a complete makeup room. I had everything just for me. With the independents, you're kind of roughing it, literally.::Tippi Hedren
I use every single thing that Alfred Hitchcock taught me in my acting career... I am very grateful for the education he gave me in making motion pictures.::Tippi Hedren
I could really use a corporate sponsor. People think that because you're in the movies, you're rich. I have allocated all my resources to Shambala so the animals will always be safe.::Tippi Hedren
Some folks are wise and some are otherwise.::Tobias Smollett
The strong manly ones in life are those who understand the meaning of the word patience.::Tokugawa Ieyasu
Patience means restraining one's inclinations.::Tokugawa Ieyasu
We are pre-disposed for fantasy, there is a natural impulse for human beings to want to get off their heads or out of their heads in something in a substance or a drink or an idea or a religion which will comfort them and make life exciting.::Tom Baker
The Old Testament is my favourite science fantasy reading.::Tom Baker
We have newsreaders behaving like actors, lowering their voices if it's a sad story, as if we didn't know it's a sad story. There isn't a single cool newsreader.::Tom Baker
I have never described the time I was in Doctor Who as anything except a kind of ecstatic success, but all the rest has been rather a muddle and a disappointment. Compared to Doctor Who, it has been an outrageous failure really - it's so boring.::Tom Baker
Being a father to my family and a husband is to me much more important than what I did in the business.::Tom Bosley
In the relationship between man and religion, the state is firmly committed to a position of neutrality.::Tom C. Clark
We were learning together. We'd go to various clinics and try to learn as much as possible.::Tom Conway
My Dad died during the flu epidemic in 1918 when I was 4 years old. He left a lot of classical recordings behind that I began listening to at an early age, so he must have been a music lover.::Tom Glazer
Just this morning, out of a large memory for songs, and having been obsessed by them since childhood, suddenly, at the age of 84, I thought of a song I hadn't thought of in over 50 years. It came into my head unbidden.::Tom Glazer
I'm afraid I talk a lot, too much, perhaps. I should have been a lawyer or a college professor or a windy politician, though I'm glad I am not any of these.::Tom Glazer
When I was in Philadelphia during the Depression in 1930 or '31, I got a very sad job as a night watchman in a garage. The cars in the garage had been abandoned by their owners, since they had lost their jobs and couldn't keep up the payments.::Tom Glazer
I published, privately, a collection of my serious poetry I had written over the years. I only published 50 copies, which I gave to friends, in a special deluxe edition. It was ridiculously expensive but I'm glad that I did it.::Tom Glazer
America's health care system is in crisis precisely because we systematically neglect wellness and prevention.::Tom Harkin
Let's face it, in America today we don't have a health care system, we have a sick care system.::Tom Harkin
The issue of civil rights was too much for the establishment to handle. One of the chapters of history that's least studied by historians is the 300 to 500 riots in the U.S. between 1965 and 1970.::Tom Hayden
Repeat anything often enough and it will start to become you.::Tom Hopkins
Do what you fear most and you control fear.::Tom Hopkins

I never see failure as failure, but only as the game I must play and win.::Tom Hopkins
Leadership is a matter of having people look at you and gain confidence, seeing how you react. If you're in control, they're in control.::Tom Landry
Football is an incredible game. Sometimes it's so incredible, it's unbelievable.::Tom Landry
I don't believe in team motivation. I believe in getting a team prepared so it knows it will have the necessary confidence when it steps on a field and be prepared to play a good game.::Tom Landry
Leadership is getting someone to do what they don't want to do, to achieve what they want to achieve.::Tom Landry
On July 18, we will mark the 12th anniversary of the senseless loss of 85 lives in the bombing of the Jewish Cultural Center in Buenos Aires, Argentina.::Tom Lantos
Insurgents have capitalized on popular resentment and anger towards the United States and the Iraqi government to build their own political, financial and military support, and the faith of Iraqi citizens in their new government has been severely undermined.::Tom Lantos
Let me start with Yahoo. As we meet today, a Chinese citizen who had the courage to speak his mind on the Internet is in prison because Yahoo chose to share his name and address with the Chinese Government.::Tom Lantos
The patience of the American public with dilatory diplomatic delays will be very limited.::Tom Lantos
The Chinese leadership hoped that the world would soon forget the Tiananmen Square massacre. Our job in Congress is to ensure that we never forget those who lost their lives in Tiananmen Square that day or the pro-democracy cause for which they fought.::Tom Lantos
Hezbollah's contempt for human suffering is total, as it showed once again this morning when its rockets murdered two Israeli Arab children in Nazareth.::Tom Lantos
My last public performance for money was in 1967. For free, it was 1972, with the exception of two little one-shot, one-song things. But that's just for friends, out of friendship for the people involved, and also because it was fun.::Tom Lehrer
Laughter is involuntary. If it's funny you laugh.::Tom Lehrer
It is a sobering thought that when Mozart was my age, he had been dead for two years.::Tom Lehrer
When you get to fifty-two food becomes more important than sex.::Tom Lehrer
Political satire became obsolete when they awarded Henry Kissinger the Nobel Peace Prize.::Tom Lehrer
The odds are always against you no matter what your previous history is. You have to overcome the tendency to relax.::Tom Osborne
If little else, the brain is an educational toy.::Tom Robbins
To some extent, Seattle remains a frontier metropolis, a place where people can experiment with their lives, and change and grow and make things happen.::Tom Robbins
We waste time looking for the perfect lover, instead of creating the perfect love.::Tom Robbins
Religion is not merely the opium of the masses, it's the cyanide.::Tom Robbins
Disbelief in magic can force a poor soul into believing in government and business.::Tom Robbins
In Seattle, I soon found that my radical ideas and aesthetic explorations - ideas and explorations that in Richmond, Virginia, might have gotten me stoned to death with hush puppies - were not only accepted but occasionally applauded.::Tom Robbins
People write memoirs because they lack the imagination to make things up.::Tom Robbins
Education is for growth and fulfillment.::Tom Robbins
Equality is not in regarding different things similarly, equality is in regarding different things differently.::Tom Robbins
I think that the present is worth attention, one shouldn't sacrifice it to future conceptions of, of this future or that future.::Tom Stoppard
Back in the East you can't do much without the right papers, but with the right papers you can do anything The believe in papers. Papers are power.::Tom Stoppard
I was delighted to not go to university. I couldn't wait to be out of education.::Tom Stoppard
I was interested by the idea that artists working in a totalitarian dictatorship or tsarist autocracy are secretly and slightly shamefully envied by artists who work in freedom. They have the gratification of intense interest: the authorities want to put them in jail, while there are younger readers for whom what they write is pure oxygen.::Tom Stoppard
I still believe that if your aim is to change the world, journalism is a more immediate short-term weapon.::Tom Stoppard
Well I believe in the desirability of an optimal society.::Tom Stoppard
Any revival in which I am involved is liable to change.::Tom Stoppard
I write out of my intellectual experience.::Tom Stoppard
Age is a very high price to pay for maturity.::Tom Stoppard
It's not the voting that's democracy it's the counting.::Tom Stoppard
I think age is a very high price to pay for maturity.::Tom Stoppard
Beauty is desired in order that it may be befouled not for its own sake, but for the joy brought by the certainty of profaning it.::Tom Stoppard
From as long as, literally as far back as I can remember I've liked puns, word jokes, I can literally recall looking at a comic at the age of six or seven and I remember what I enjoyed and what it was precisely and how the joke worked.::Tom Stoppard
I don't act, I don't direct, I don't design.::Tom Stoppard
My work always tried to unite the true with the beautiful but when I had to choose one or the other, I usually chose the beautiful.::Tom Stoppard
From principles is derived probability, but truth or certainty is obtained only from facts.::Tom Stoppard
It is not hard to understand modern art. If it hangs on a wall it's a painting, and if you can walk around it it's a sculpture.::Tom Stoppard
The House of Lords, an illusion to which I have never been able to subscribe - responsibility without power, the prerogative of the eunuch throughout the ages.::Tom Stoppard
A healthy attitude is contagious but don't wait to catch it from others. Be a carrier.::Tom Stoppard
Skill without imagination is craftsmanship and gives us many useful objects such as wickerwork picnic baskets. Imagination without skill gives us modern art.::Tom Stoppard
I like pop music. I consider rock 'n' roll to be a branch of pop music.::Tom Stoppard
You can't but know that if you can capture the emotions of the audience as well as their minds, the play will work better, because it's a narrative art form.::Tom Stoppard
I have my own religion. I'm sort of one-quarter Baptist, one-quarter Catholic, one-quarter Jewish.::Tom T. Hall
My theory is if you have a religion, it's a good one. Because some people don't have any at all.::Tom T. Hall
Religion is a strange, wonderful thing. More crimes have been committed in the name of righteousness than any other notion.::Tom T. Hall
Whiskey's to tough, Champagne costs too much, Vodka puts my mouth in gear. I hope this refrain, Will help me explain, As a matter of fact, I like beer.::Tom T. Hall
It used to be that you'd have a song recorded by a major country artist and if it was a hit, you could buy a car. Now you can buy a dealership.::Tom T. Hall
When you retire, it's a place in life, a part of the journey. You just don't quit work you develop an attitude where you can do what you please.::Tom T. Hall
The first guy who came up with the concept of religion was sitting out under a tree. I'm sure of that.::Tom T. Hall
I didn't want to deal in poetry. I got rid of that after a few months.::Tom Wesselmann
This is the artist, then, life's hungry man, the glutton of eternity, beauty's miser, glory's slave.::Tom Wolfe
There are some people who have the quality of richness and joy in them and they communicate it to everything they touch. It is first of all a physical quality then it is a quality of the spirit.::Tom Wolfe
The notion that the public accepts or rejects anything in modern art is merely romantic fiction. The game is completed and the trophies distributed long before the public knows what has happened.::Tom Wolfe
A cult is a religion with no political power.::Tom Wolfe
There has been a time on earth when poets had been young and dead and famous - and were men. But now the poet as the tragic child of grandeur and destiny had changed. The child of genius was a woman, now, and the man was gone.::Tom Wolfe
The attitude is we live and let live. This is actually an amazing change in values in a rather short time and it's an example of freedom from religion.::Tom Wolfe
If you are going to throw a club, it is important to throw it ahead of you, down the fairway, so you don't have to waste energy going back to pick it up.::Tommy Bolt
I noticed that this defense attorney is a very, very intelligent man, and he's very cool and he's very knowledgeable, and I think that personally I'd like to have an attorney like him.::Tommy Bond
To be in a situation where you have no rights whatsoever is something I wish everybody could experience. People's attitudes would change. It would be a better place.::Tommy Chong
We won a contest at the teen fair in Vancouver and the first prize was a recording contract and we recorded at a radio station on the stairway, and we did a record and it got put out.::Tommy Chong
Religion is run by thought police. 'Obey. Listen. This is what you do. Don't ask questions. Go die for your country.' The spirituality says, 'Okay, you can die for your country, but know what you're doing while you're doing it.'::Tommy Chong
If I don't get paid I'm going to take a whole lot of Marshall amps home with me on the plane.::Tommy Chong
The funny thing is, Dennis Miller got me back into comedy.::Tommy Chong
My incarceration was actually a positive thing from the beginning. I needed a gimmick to get my act going again, it gave me material.::Tommy Chong
Well, my wife and I were married in a toilet - it was a marriage of convenience!::Tommy Cooper
A woman tells her doctor, 'I've got a bad back.' The doctor says, 'It's old age.' The woman says, 'I want a second opinion.' The doctor says: 'Okay - you're ugly as well.'::Tommy Cooper
So I was getting into my car, and this bloke says to me 'Can you give me a lift?' I said 'Sure, you look great, the world's your oyster, go for it.'::Tommy Cooper
Courage, my friends 'tis not too late to build a better world.::Tommy Douglas
About the only problem with success is that it does not teach you how to deal with failure.::Tommy Lasorda
Baseball is like driving, it's the one who gets home safely that counts.::Tommy Lasorda
Pressure is a word that is misused in our vocabulary. When you start thinking of pressure, it's because you've started to think of failure.::Tommy Lasorda
The dream is real, my friends. The failure to realize it is the only unreality.::Toni Cade Bambara
And what is religion, you might ask. It's a technology of living.::Toni Cade Bambara
You need a whole community to raise a child. I have raised two children, alone.::Toni Morrison
Black literature is taught as sociology, as tolerance, not as a serious, rigorous art form.::Toni Morrison
The body is ready to have babies. Nature wants it done then, when the body can handle it, not after 40, when the income can handle it.::Toni Morrison
All water has a perfect memory and is forever trying to get back to where it was.::Toni Morrison
Black people have always been used as a buffer in this country between powers to prevent class war.::Toni Morrison
I like marriage. The idea.::Toni Morrison
She is a friend of mind. She gather me, man. The pieces I am, she gather them and give them back to me in all the right order. It's good, you know, when you got a woman who is a friend of your mind.::Toni Morrison
The ability of writers to imagine what is not the self, to familiarize the strange and mystify the familiar, is the test of their power.::Toni Morrison
At some point in life the world's beauty becomes enough. You don't need to photograph, paint or even remember it. It is enough.::Toni Morrison
As you enter positions of trust and power, dream a little before you think.::Toni Morrison
There is nothing of any consequence in education, in the economy, in city planning, in social policy that does not concern black people.::Toni Morrison
Everybody gets everything handed to them. The rich inherit it. I don't mean just inheritance of money. I mean what people take for granted among the middle and upper classes, which is nepotism, the old-boy network.::Toni Morrison
I merged those two words, black and feminist, because I was surrounded by black women who were very tough and and who always assumed they had to work and rear children and manage homes.::Toni Morrison
It's been mentioned or suggested that Paradise will not be well studied, because it's about this unimportant intellectual topic, which is religion.::Toni Morrison
I don't think anybody cares about unwed mothers unless they're black or poor. The question is not morality, the question is money. That's what we're upset about.::Toni Morrison
Women's rights is not only an abstraction, a cause it is also a personal affair. It is not only about us it is also about me and you. Just the two of us.::Toni Morrison
I don't think a female running a house is a problem, a broken family. It's perceived as one because of the notion that a head is a man.::Toni Morrison
A faith is something you die for, a doctrine is something you kill for. There is all the difference in the world.::Tony Benn
We are not just here to manage capitalism but to change society and to define its finer values.::Tony Benn
It's the same each time with progress. First they ignore you, then they say you're mad, then dangerous, then there's a pause and then you can't find anyone who disagrees with you.::Tony Benn
All war represents a failure of diplomacy.::Tony Benn
I know the history of the record business so well because I followed Billie Holiday into the record studios. It was so primitive compared to the sophisticated business today.::Tony Bennett
After-school tutoring programs, care for the elderly, shelters for the homeless, disaster relief work, and a variety of other services would all benefit from government funding.::Tony Campolo
Sigmund Freud was the apostle of disbelief. He was the one who made psychoanalysis a part of our culture, and in so doing he kicked out a flying buttress that had been essential for holding up our cathedral of faith.::Tony Campolo
But I think it's up to a local congregation to determine whether or not a marriage should be blessed of God. And it shouldn't be up to the government.::Tony Campolo
The first reason for the preponderant influence of those Evangelicals who define themselves as advocates of Religious Right theological and political ideologies is that they have both the financial means and technological know-how to make widespread use of modern electronic forms of communication.::Tony Campolo
So I really would like to see both parties respond to the poor with greater commitment. But I've got to tell you, the Democrats, I feel, are doing a better job in that respect than Republicans are.::Tony Campolo
It's a new day for the Democrats when it comes to matters of faith, and the younger Evangelicals are aware of this and many of them are moving into the Democratic camp.::Tony Campolo
If marriage really is a sacred institution, then why is the government controlling it, especially in a nation that affirms separation of church and state?::Tony Campolo
I don't know of many evangelicals who want to deny gay couples their legal rights. However, most of us don't want to call it marriage, because we think that word has religious connotations, and we're not ready to see it used in ways that offend us.::Tony Campolo
It is hard to say what the future holds, but this is probable - it won't be just like the past.::Tony Campolo
From the beginning, there have been some religious leaders who greeted the funding of faith-based social services by government with ambivalence.::Tony Campolo
Who's to say that there is any more support for Freud's psychoanalytic concept of the superego than there is for that old time religion that asserted that there is a God who ordains what is right and wrong, and that His righteousness endures for all generations?::Tony Campolo
If a guy is intimidated by a woman in leadership, he has real problems with his own concepts of masculinity. That's a harsh statement, but I believe it to be true.::Tony Campolo
The traditional spokespersons for the Evangelicals, such as Chuck Colson and James Dobson, have become alarmed about this drift away from the 'Family Values' issues that they believe should be the overwhelming concerns of Evangelicals. They have expressed their displeasure in letters of protest circulated through the religious media.::Tony Campolo
I propose that the government should get out of the business of marrying people and, instead, only give legal status to civil unions.::Tony Campolo
Those issues are biblical issues: to care for the sick, to feed the hungry, to stand up for the oppressed. I contend that if the evangelical community became more biblical, everything would change.::Tony Campolo
Clinton's successor in the White House, George W. Bush, was committed to expanding government spending for faith-based initiatives.::Tony Campolo
I, for one, am quite willing to join the 'forgive, forget and move on' crowd, but it does make me wonder if Evangelicals are going to sound believable when they say that they tend to vote Republican because of their religious commitments to the family.::Tony Campolo
Sadly, we do a much better job of making people feel guilty than we do of delivering them from the guilt we create. We need to confess this and change our ways.::Tony Campolo
Religion, for better or for worse, has been politicized in blatant ways that have seldom been equaled in American elections.::Tony Campolo
And we've got to ask ourselves some very serious questions as to whether or not certain religious leaders, in terms of raising money - I hate to bring this up - are pushing hot buttons.::Tony Campolo
Red Letter Christians believe in the doctrines of the Apostle's Creed, are convinced that the Scriptures have been inspired by the Holy Spirit, and make having a personal transforming relationship with the resurrected Christ the touchtone of their faith.::Tony Campolo
So after the Lewinsky scandal, everything changed, and we moved from using the Bible to address the moral issues of our time, which were social, to moral issues of our time that were very personal. I have continued that relationship up until the present.::Tony Campolo
What is especially important is addressing the question of how religion can be enforced through political means and what can be done to create a political environment that, on the one hand, acknowledges the role of religion in society, while on the other hand does not impose one religion on the populace at the expense of all others.::Tony Campolo
Flipping the dial through available radio stations there will blare out to any listener an array of broadcasts, 24\/7, propagating Religious Right politics, along with what they deem to be 'old-time gospel preaching.' This is especially true of what comes over the airwaves in Bible Belt southern states.::Tony Campolo
President Bush once said that marriage is a sacred institution and should be reserved for the union of one man and one woman. If this is the case - and most Americans would agree with him on this - then I have to ask: Why is the government at all involved in marrying people?::Tony Campolo
Getting the government to put money into social programs run by religious institutions is a practice that started during the Clinton years, when Bill Clinton advocated the AmeriCorps program.::Tony Campolo
What if Barack Obama established a Presidential Advisory Committee that would meet once every couple of months, bringing together the former presidents for a conference in order to seek their collective wisdom? There is a wealth of experience in former presidents that generally goes untapped.::Tony Campolo
I am looking for suggestions on what we can do about extremists within our own society. They cannot be ignored.::Tony Campolo
While a case can be made for intelligent design, I can't figure out why some Christians are so thrilled about that possibility. First of all, it doesn't prove there's a God. If anything, intelligent design lends support to some form of pantheism that defines God as immanent within nature.::Tony Campolo
I contend the state ought to do its thing and provide legal rights for all couples who want to be joined together for life. The church should bless unions that it sees fit to bless, and they should be called marriages.::Tony Campolo
There is no doubt that religion had already waned under the onslaught of the Enlightenment, but it was Freud who provided the radically new understanding of human nature that made any religious explanation of the whats and whys of our personhood seem naive.::Tony Campolo
Most Evangelicals claim to be politically non-partisan, and say they only identify with the Republican Party because the Republicans are committed to 'family values.'::Tony Campolo
I am not suggesting that all those missionary organizations working in Haiti should pack up and go home, but I am urging them to understand that Haiti does not need clever Americans with newly contrived schemes for saving their country.::Tony Campolo
Certain things happened in the early church. Women who had never had any freedom suddenly have the ability to stand up and speak and be treated as equals within the life of the church.::Tony Campolo
Marriage should be viewed as an institution ordained by God and should be out of the control of the state.::Tony Campolo
But I contend that if we're providing total medical coverage for every man, woman, and child in Iraq, shouldn't we at least be doing the same thing for every man, woman, and child in the United States?::Tony Campolo
I'm world famous, everywhere I go there are people who love me because of I've been able to bring them some joy from the movies I've made.::Tony Curtis
We try to... we are, I suppose to a certain extent all affected and erm, that is both funny and sad I think.::Tony Hancock
It's both funny and sad which seem to me to be the two basic ingredients of good comedy.::Tony Hancock
The essays in The Great Taos Bank Robbery were my project to win a Master of Arts degree in English when I quit being a newspaper editor and went back to college.::Tony Hillerman
I always have one or two, sometimes more, Navajo or other tribes' cultural elements in mind when I start a plot. In Thief of Time, I wanted to make readers aware of Navajo attitude toward the dead, respect for burial sites.::Tony Hillerman
A buoyant, positive approach to the game is as basic as a sound swing.::Tony Lema
There's only one thing worse than a man who doesn't have strong likes and dislikes, and that's a man who has strong likes and dislikes without the courage to voice them.::Tony Randall
Sooner or later, we sell out for money.::Tony Randall
Marilyn Monroe was no fun to work with. She would report to work around 5:00 in the evening. You've been in make-up since 8:30 in the morning waiting for her.::Tony Randall
Failure is not fatal victory is not success.::Tony Richardson
You can be in Tokyo or Alberta at four in the morning in your hotel and you can still practice if you feel like it. A trombone cannot do that at four in the morning.::Toots Thielemans
Love is when he gives you a piece of your soul, that you never knew was missing.::Torquato Tasso
The day of fortune is like a harvest day, We must be busy when the corn is ripe.::Torquato Tasso

In government offices which are sensitive to the vehemence and passion of mass sentiment public men have no sure tenure. They are in effect perpetual office seekers, always on trial for their political lives, always required to court their restless constituents.::Walter Lippmann
In a free society the state does not administer the affairs of men. It administers justice among men who conduct their own affairs.::Walter Lippmann
Private property was the original source of freedom. It still is its main ballpark.::Walter Lippmann
The private citizen, beset by partisan appeals for the loan of his Public Opinion, will soon see, perhaps, that these appeals are not a compliment to his intelligence, but an imposition on his good nature and an insult to his sense of evidence.::Walter Lippmann

A very intimate sense of the expressiveness of outward things, which ponders, listens, penetrates, where the earlier, less developed consciousness passed lightly by, is an important element in the general temper of our modern poetry.::Walter Pater
All art constantly aspires towards the condition of music.::Walter Pater
What is important, then, is not that the critic should possess a correct abstract definition of beauty for the intellect, but a certain kind of temperament, the power of being deeply moved by the presence of beautiful objects.::Walter Pater
In a sense it might even be said that our failure is to form habits: for, after all, habit is relative to a stereotyped world, and meantime it is only the roughness of the eye that makes two persons, things, situations, seem alike.::Walter Pater
To burn always with this hard, gem-like flame, to maintain this ecstasy, is success in life.::Walter Pater

Such discussions help us very little to enjoy what has been well done in art or poetry, to discriminate between what is more and what is less excellent in them, or to use words like beauty, excellence, art, poetry, with a more precise meaning than they would otherwise have.::Walter Pater
Not the fruit of experience, but experience itself, is the end.::Walter Pater
Many attempts have been made by writers on art and poetry to define beauty in the abstract, to express it in the most general terms, to find some universal formula for it.::Walter Pater
One of the most beautiful passages of Rousseau is that in the sixth book of Confessions, where he describes the awakening in him of the literary sense. Of such wisdom, the poetic passion, the desire of beauty, the love of art for its own sake, has most.::Walter Pater
That sense of a life in natural objects, which in most poetry is but a rhetorical artifice, was, then, in Wordsworth the assertion of what was for him almost literal fact.::Walter Pater

The only positive finding which could be drawn from the first series, was the conclusion that the relationships obviously had a more complicated lay-out than had been thought, for the effects were so varied that no obedience to any law could be discovered.::Walter Rudolf Hess

Lenin said that people vote with their feet. Well, that's what's happening. They either go, or they don't go. It's all politics. It's all demographics.::Warren Beatty

The rich are always going to say that, you know, just give us more money and we'll go out and spend more and then it will all trickle down to the rest of you. But that has not worked the last 10 years, and I hope the American public is catching on.::Warren Buffett
You do things when the opportunities come along. I've had periods in my life when I've had a bundle of ideas come along, and I've had long dry spells. If I get an idea next week, I'll do something. If not, I won't do a damn thing.::Warren Buffett
Americans are in a cycle of fear which leads to people not wanting to spend and not wanting to make investments, and that leads to more fear. We'll break out of it. It takes time.::Warren Buffett

If past history was all there was to the game, the richest people would be librarians.::Warren Buffett

We believe that according the name 'investors' to institutions that trade actively is like calling someone who repeatedly engages in one-night stands a 'romantic.'::Warren Buffett

The business schools reward difficult complex behavior more than simple behavior, but simple behavior is more effective.::Warren Buffett
We've used up a lot of bullets. And we talk about stimulus. But the truth is, we're running a federal deficit that's 9 percent of GDP. That is stimulative as all get out. It's more stimulative than any policy we've followed since World War II.::Warren Buffett
When a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact.::Warren Buffett
The Palestinian election is something that was really a turning point. It's a mandate for peace.::Warren Christopher

This is a very important relationship we have with Russia, the relationship over the nuclear arsenal that they have obviously is important. They're a very powerful country.::Warren Christopher

The other thing about FEMA, my understanding is that it was supposed to move into the Department of Homeland Security... and be what it was, but also having a lot of lateral communication with all those others involved in that issue of homeland security.::Warren Rudman
Hitting is timing. Pitching is upsetting timing.::Warren Spahn
After all, it is the divinity within that makes the divinity without and I have been more fascinated by a woman of talent and intelligence, though deficient in personal charms, than I have been by the most regular beauty.::Washington Irving

A woman's whole life is a history of the affections.::Washington Irving

There is never jealousy where there is not strong regard.::Washington Irving
Acting provides the fulfillment of never being fulfilled. You're never as good as you'd like to be. So there's always something to hope for.::Washington Irving

It is a horrible fact that we can read in the daily paper, without interrupting our breakfast, numerical reckonings of death and destruction that ought to break our hearts or scare us out of our wits.::Wendell Berry
We cannot know the whole truth, which belongs to God alone, but our task nevertheless is to seek to know what is true.

We must honestly face our relationship with Great Britain.::Wendell Willkie
In no direction that we turn do we find ease or comfort. If we are honest and if we have the will to win we find only danger, hard work and iron resolution.::Wendell Willkie

If we want to talk about freedom, we must mean freedom for others as well as ourselves, and we must mean freedom for everyone inside our frontiers as well as outside.::Wendell Willkie
History shows that our way of life is the stronger way. From it has come more wealth, more industry, more happiness, more human enlightenment than from any other way.::Wendell Willkie
Freedom is an indivisible word. If we want to enjoy it, and fight for it, we must be prepared to extend it to everyone, whether they are rich or poor, whether they agree with us or not, no matter what their race or the color of their skin.::Wendell Willkie

A witness, in the sense that I am using the word, is a man whose life and faith are so completely one that when the challenge comes to step out and testify for his faith, he does so, disregarding all risks, accepting all consequences.::Whittaker Chambers
Human societies, like human beings, live by faith and die when faith dies.::Whittaker Chambers
At issue was the question whether this man's faith could prevail against a man whose equal faith it was that this society is sick beyond saving, and that mercy itself pleads for its swift extinction and replacement by another.::Whittaker Chambers
At issue in the Hiss Case was the question whether this sick society, which we call Western civilization, could in its extremity still cast up a man whose faith in it was so great that he would voluntarily abandon those things which men hold good, including life, to defend it.::Whittaker Chambers
The first novel I wrote was a monster - clocking in at 180,000 words - but it died a death, a death it deserved. It was called 'The Gods First Make Mad.' It was a good title, but it was the only good thing about the book. I didn't let that put me off.::Wilbur Smith

I think money is essential to happiness and right now I wouldn't want to be anyone other than Wilbur Smith - I've had a fantastic life, rewarded far more heavily than I deserve. Maybe I'd like to be J. K. Rowling, but I'll settle for second best.::Wilbur Smith
I'm not a prophet I can only use historical reality to come to a view of the future, and my view is that Africa will return to being African and not European.::Wilbur Smith
I have been blessed in many ways, and one of those is to have been born in Africa, for me a great treasure house of stories. I have been researching it since my infancy reading about it, talking to men and women who have spent their lives in this land, living it as I have and loving it as I do. I write almost entirely from my own experience.::Wilbur Smith
I hate politics. I like to write about it, but to get involved in it, to try and make a lot of ignorant people do what you want them to do, waste of time. Go and write a book. It's more important and it'll last longer.::Wilbur Smith
There's nothing so aphrodisiacal for a woman as money and success.::Wilbur Smith
I wanted to be a great white hunter, a prospector for gold, or a slave trader. But then, when I was eight, my parents sent me to a boarding school in South Africa. It was the equivalent of a British public school with cold showers, beatings and rotten food. But what it also had was a library full of books.::Wilbur Smith
My mother-in-law speaks not a word of English. I speak not a word of Tajiki. So I smile at her ingratiatingly and she fixes me with a beady eye.::Wilbur Smith

One reason the human race has such a low opinion of itself is that it gets so much of its wisdom from writers.::Wilfrid Sheed
Thus, in accordance with the spirit of the Historical School, knowledge of the principles of the human world falls within that world itself, and the human sciences form an independent system.::Wilhelm Dilthey
To attempt this would be like seeing without eyes or directing the gaze of knowledge behind one's own eye. Modern science can acknowledge no other than this epistemological stand-point.::Wilhelm Dilthey
A knowledge of the forces that rule society, of the causes that have produced its upheavals, and of society's resources for promoting healthy progress has become of vital concern to our civilization.::Wilhelm Dilthey

Love, work, and knowledge are the wellsprings of our lives, they should also govern it.::Wilhelm Reich
Fame, I have already. Now I need the money.::Wilhelm Steinitz
The attitude of physiological psychology to sensations and feelings, considered as psychical elements, is, naturally, the attitude of psychology at large.::Wilhelm Wundt
I am more and more convinced that our happiness or our unhappiness depends far more on the way we meet the events of life than on the nature of those events themselves.::Wilhelm von Humboldt
True enjoyment comes from activity of the mind and exercise of the body the two are ever united.::Wilhelm von Humboldt
However great an evil immorality may be, we must not forget that it is not without its beneficial consequences. It is only through extremes that men can arrive at the middle path of wisdom and virtue.::Wilhelm von Humboldt
Coercion may prevent many transgressions but it robs even actions which are legal of a part of their beauty. Freedom may lead to many transgressions, but it lends even to vices a less ignoble form.::Wilhelm von Humboldt

I received $100 per week when I started working at the Globe after graduation.::Will McDonough
I think money in general hurts all sports.::Will McDonough
The two major things that changed the makeup of all professional sports are money generated by television and courts that players went to in order to win their freedom as free agents.::Will McDonough
One of my first jobs was at the Boston Globe. I worked in the sports department six months a year. When I was ready to graduate, the sports editor gave me a job as a schoolboy sports writer.::Will McDonough

Failure has gone to his head.::Wilson Mizner
The difference between chirping out of turn and a faux pas depends on what kind of a bar you're in.::Wilson Mizner
